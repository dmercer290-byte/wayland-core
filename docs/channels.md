# Channels — inbound security model

genesis-core can receive messages from chat platforms (Telegram, Discord,
Slack, Signal, …) and answer them with an agent turn. Because a channel
sender is **remote** — and, depending on your access policy, possibly
untrusted — inbound traffic passes through two independent security gates
before and around the agent turn:

1. **Access policy** — *who* may drive the agent (fail-closed allowlists).
2. **Tool posture** — *what the agent may touch* on the host (no filesystem
   or shell by default).

Both are configured per channel in that channel's config file under
`~/.genesis/channels/<name>.toml`, in the `[inbound]` table.

> If `[inbound]` is absent, the channel is **fail-closed**: every inbound
> message is denied. Inbound dispatch does nothing until you opt in.

## Access policy — who may drive the agent

```toml
# ~/.genesis/channels/tg.toml
platform = "telegram"

[inbound]
dm = "allowlist"                 # open | allowlist | pairing | disabled
dm_allowlist = ["123456789"]     # stable platform sender ids; "*" = anyone
group = "disabled"               # open | allowlist | disabled
require_mention = true           # in groups, only act when addressed
```

Defaults (used for any unset field) are the fail-closed posture:
`dm = "allowlist"` with an **empty** `dm_allowlist` (so no one is
permitted), `group = "disabled"`, `require_mention = true`.

**Lock `dm_allowlist` to specific sender ids.** `dm_allowlist = ["*"]`
opens DMs to *anyone who can find the bot* — only use it for a throwaway
test bot, never a deployment. To allow a specific person, add their stable
platform `sender_id` (e.g. their Telegram numeric user id):

```toml
dm = "allowlist"
dm_allowlist = ["123456789"]     # only this user may DM the bot
```

Allowlist semantics: a list permits an id **iff** it contains the literal
`"*"` (wildcard) **or** the exact id. An empty list permits nothing. Group
acceptance under `group = "allowlist"` requires BOTH the group
(`group_allowlist`) AND the sender (`sender_allowlist`) to be listed.

## Tool posture — what the agent may touch

A channel turn runs a real agent engine on your host. Without scoping, the
built-in `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` tools (which are auto-approved) would let a
remote sender read host secrets and have the reply ship them back. The
`tools` posture controls which tools a channel-originated engine is built
with:

```toml
[inbound]
tools = "conversational"         # conversational (default) | workspace | full
tool_workspace_root = "/srv/agent-workspace"   # only used by "workspace"
```

| Posture | Filesystem / shell | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **`conversational`** (default) | **None.** Only conversational/network tools (and operator-wired MCP servers) are exposed. | A chat bot that answers questions, calls APIs, and uses your MCP tools — but must never touch the host filesystem. |
| **`workspace`** | `Read`/`Write`/`Edit`/`Grep`/`Glob` are available but **jailed** to `tool_workspace_root` (a remote sender cannot read or write outside it). Shell/exec tools (`Bash`, `Git`, `kubectl`, …) stay **unavailable** — they bypass the jail. | A confined "do real work in this directory" agent reachable over chat. |
| **`full`** | **Everything**, host-wide — identical to a local CLI session. | Trusted, locked-down deployments only. Dangerous for any publicly-reachable channel. |

Notes:

- The posture is enforced at the tool registry, so a dropped tool is
  **un-dispatchable** — not merely hidden from the model. Even a
  hallucinated call cannot reach it.
- `tool_workspace_root` defaults to the agent's working directory when
  unset under `workspace`.
- The posture applies **only** to channel-originated engines. Your local
  CLI / TUI / `--json-stream` sessions always keep the full toolset.
- **MCP caveat:** operator-wired MCP servers are kept under
  `conversational` and `workspace` (they are deliberate, named
  extensions). If an MCP server itself exposes host filesystem access,
  threat-model that channel as `full`-equivalent.

## Acknowledgements — reactions & typing

So a sender knows the bot heard them, set the per-channel `ack` mode:

```toml
[inbound]
ack = "both"   # off (default) | reactions | typing | both
```

- `reactions` — the bot reacts 👀 when it receives your message, then ✅ on
  success or ❌ on failure.
- `typing` — the bot shows a "typing…" indicator, refreshed every 5s while
  it works.
- `both` — reactions + typing.

Best-effort: a connector without the platform API simply does nothing.
Ack failures never affect the reply itself. Per-connector support:

| Connector | Reactions | Typing | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Telegram  | ✅ | ✅ | `setMessageReaction` + `sendChatAction` |
| Discord   | ✅ | ✅ | `PUT …/reactions/{emoji}/@me` + `POST …/typing` |
| Matrix    | ✅ | ✅ | `m.reaction` annotation + `…/typing/{userId}` |
| Slack     | ✅ | —  | `reactions.add` (ack emoji mapped to shortcodes); Slack has no bot-usable typing API |
| WhatsApp  | ✅ | —  | reaction message; typing needs a per-message read receipt the keepalive can't carry |
| Signal / iMessage | — | — | no reaction/typing API surface wired |

Slack maps the ack emoji (👀/✅/❌) to its shortcodes (`eyes`/`white_check_mark`/`x`)
because `reactions.add` takes a name, not a unicode glyph.

## Inbound media (images & voice notes)

When an inbound message carries an image or audio attachment, the agent
turns it into text **before** the prompt is built: images become a short
description, voice notes become a transcript (written into the attachment's
derived-text slot). This needs a vision and/or transcription backend wired
(an `ANTHROPIC`/`OPENAI`/`GEMINI` key for vision, a `GROQ`/`OPENAI` key for
transcription); with neither configured the enricher is inert and media is
left as a bare-URL summary.

The bytes are downloaded by the **originating connector**, using that
connector's own credentials and media protocol — credentials never leave the
connector boundary (the agent-side enricher only sees bytes):

| Connector | Inbound media fetch | Mechanism |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Telegram  | ✅ | `getFile` URL (token in path), plain GET |
| Discord   | ✅ | public CDN URL, plain GET |
| Slack     | ✅ | `url_private` + `Authorization: Bearer` (scope `files:read`) |
| WhatsApp  | ✅ | media-id → `GET /<id>` (Bearer) → temp URL → GET (Bearer) |
| Matrix    | ✅ | `mxc://` → `GET /_matrix/client/v1/media/download/{server}/{id}` (Bearer); **unencrypted rooms only** |
| Signal / iMessage / email | — | no inbound-media mapping wired |

Every step is best-effort and bounded: a fetch error/timeout, an oversize
payload (>20 MB image / >25 MB audio), an unsupported format, or a backend
error all fall back to the bare-URL summary and never fail the turn. Derived
text is truncated to keep the prompt budget in check.

## Inbound webhook host (Slack / WhatsApp / Twilio SMS)

Slack, WhatsApp, and Twilio SMS receive inbound messages as HTTP webhooks
rather than by polling. Enable the receiver:

```toml
# main config (not the per-channel file)
[inbound_webhook]
enabled = true
bind = "127.0.0.1:8787"
# REQUIRED for Twilio signature verification (it signs the public URL);
# set to the exact public https URL the platform calls:
public_base_url = "https://bot.example.com"
```

Point each platform's webhook at `https://bot.example.com/webhooks/<channel-name>`
(the `<channel-name>` is the config file stem). Each connector verifies its
platform signature before accepting a message. (MS Teams inbound is parsed
but **not** exposed over the host yet — its Bot Framework JWT validation is
a pending follow-up.)

## Not yet built (channel parity follow-ups)

- Message **edit / delete** surfaces on the `Channel` trait.
- **Multi-agent conversation-binding**: each conversation already gets its
  own isolated session/engine; binding *distinct agent configs* per
  conversation/peer is not built.
- A **setup doctor / token-probe** CLI to validate channel config and
  credentials interactively.
- Outbound **idempotency nonces** (the inbound dedup already prevents
  double-processing of platform replays).
- MS Teams inbound webhook **JWT/JWKS** validation (parse exists; host
  exposure gated until then).

## Recommended deployment baseline

```toml
[inbound]
dm = "allowlist"
dm_allowlist = ["<your-platform-user-id>"]
group = "disabled"
require_mention = true
tools = "conversational"
```

This admits only you, in DMs, with no host filesystem or shell exposure.
Widen deliberately from there.
