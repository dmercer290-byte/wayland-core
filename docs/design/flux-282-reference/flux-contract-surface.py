"""Flux #282 context-routing contract — IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCE (Flux side, V1).

This is the FROZEN handshake surface extracted from the live Flux proxy
(src/forge_hook.py @ master eb6a6b2). It is the exact code that parses Core's
x-wl-* request headers, computes the full-fit floor, raises the structured 409
context_overflow, and emits the x-flux-* signal-back headers. The full proxy
routing/bandit logic around it is intentionally omitted (private + irrelevant to
the handshake). See test_context_contract.py for behavior-by-example. Not runnable
standalone — reference only.
