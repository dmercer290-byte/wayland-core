# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

## Overview

MCP allows the agent to connect to external tool servers, extending beyond the 7 built-in tools to the entire MCP server ecosystem.

## Configuring MCP Servers

Declare MCP servers in the config file:

```toml
# Stdio transport: launch a local subprocess
[mcp.servers.filesystem]
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/project"]

[mcp.servers.github]
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
env = { GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_xxx" }

# SSE transport: connect to a remote SSE server
[mcp.servers.database]
transport = "sse"
url = "http://localhost:3001/sse"

# Streamable HTTP transport: HTTP POST communication
[mcp.servers.remote-tools]
transport = "streamable-http"
url = "https://tools.example.com/mcp"
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer xxx" }
```

## Zero-config discovery (Forge local servers)

Forge-suite desktop apps (e.g. Agent Vault) advertise a loopback MCP server by
writing a shared file at `<OS config dir>/forge/mcp-servers.json` — the *real*
config dir (`dirs::config_dir()`), NOT `GENESIS_HOME`, since it is a
cross-application convention written by *other* apps about the actual machine.
Genesis Core auto-detects those entries and surfaces them as **DISCOVERED** rows
in `/doctor`. Nothing connects automatically: a discovery entry is a **hint, not
liveness** (a producer crash leaves a stale entry behind), so you connect a row
explicitly with `/mcp connect [name]` (or by selecting the row and pressing
Enter).

On connect, the engine runs the two-step bootstrap:

1. **Liveness probe** — `GET <metadata_url>`. The connect is only offered when a
   `200` comes back *and* the server's reported `name` matches the discovery
   entry. A mismatch (or any non-200) is treated as a stale/impostor entry and
   rejected.
2. **Grant** — `POST <grant_url>`. This pops an **Approve** prompt in the
   producer app; the call only returns successfully after the user clicks
   Approve. The response maps to a structured outcome:

   | Status | Outcome |
   |--------|---------|
   | `200` | Granted — a scoped bearer token is returned and stored, and the server connects live |
   | `403` | Denied (user declined, no UI, or timed out) |
   | `400` | Bad scopes — surfaced with the server's message |
   | `429` | Rate-limited — back off |

The token is stored out of `config.toml` via a credential reference (see
[Token storage](#token-storage-cred-references) below).

### Token storage (`${cred:}` references)

The scoped bearer token is never written into `config.toml`. Instead the
persisted `Authorization` header carries a `${cred:KEY}` reference, with the key
convention `mcp:<server>:token`. The literal `${cred:...}` stays on disk; the
real secret is looked up from the credentials store and substituted in **at the
connect boundary, on a clone** of the server map — so an accidental re-serialize
of the in-memory config can't leak the token back to disk. Resolution **fails
closed**: a missing key aborts the whole header value rather than emitting a
blank or half-resolved bearer.

The on-disk shape for a discovered Forge server:

```toml
[mcp.servers.agent-vault]
transport = "streamable-http"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp"
allow_local = true
[mcp.servers.agent-vault.headers]
Authorization = "Bearer ${cred:mcp:agent-vault:token}"
```

## Transport Types

| Transport | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `stdio` | Launch local subprocess, communicate via stdin/stdout | Local MCP servers (npx, uvx) |
| `sse` | GET for SSE event stream, POST for requests | Remote MCP servers |
| `streamable-http` | HTTP POST, supports SSE streaming responses | Remote MCP servers |

> **Windows stdio resolution.** On Windows, a `stdio` server launched by bare
> name (`npx`, `uvx`, `node`) resolves through `cmd /C` so that `.cmd`/`.bat`
> PATHEXT shims (`npx.cmd`, `node.cmd`) — which raw `CreateProcess` refuses to
> find on `PATH` — are resolved correctly. This is automatic; no host action or
> config knob is needed.

## Deferred Loading

MCP tools can be registered as "deferred" — their full schema is not loaded into the system prompt at startup, reducing initial token usage. The LLM discovers deferred tools via the `ToolSearch` tool when needed.

```toml
[mcp.servers.large-toolset]
transport = "stdio"
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "my-mcp-server"]
deferred = true    # Don't load tool schemas at startup
```

| `deferred` | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| `false` (default for config servers) | Tool schemas included in system prompt at startup |
| `true` | Tools registered but schemas loaded on-demand via ToolSearch |

Use `deferred = true` for MCP servers with many tools to keep the initial system prompt small.

## Local (loopback) MCP servers — `allow_local`

For safety, the HTTP transports (`sse`, `streamable-http`) refuse to connect to
URLs that resolve to private/internal addresses — an SSRF guard that stops a
compromised or model-driven URL from reaching `169.254.169.254`, your LAN, etc.
By default this also blocks **loopback** (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`).

An MCP server you configure by hand is *trusted configuration*, not a
model-supplied URL, so to connect to a local MCP server (e.g. a desktop app
exposing tools on `127.0.0.1`) set `allow_local = true`. This relaxes the
**loopback block only** — every other private/LAN/link-local/CGNAT/cloud-metadata
range stays blocked even when enabled.

```toml
# Example: connect to Agent Vault (desktop) running a local MCP server.
[mcp.servers.agent-vault]
transport = "streamable-http"
url = "http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp"
allow_local = true
headers = { Authorization = "Bearer <AGENT_VAULT_MCP_TOKEN>" }
```

| `allow_local` | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|
| `false` (default) | Loopback and all private/internal targets are rejected at connect time |
| `true` | Loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, `localhost`) is permitted; all other private/internal/metadata ranges remain blocked |

To keep the bearer token out of `config.toml`, a header value may use a
`${cred:KEY}` reference (e.g. `Authorization = "Bearer ${cred:mcp:agent-vault:token}"`)
— the literal reference is stored on disk and the secret is resolved from the
credentials store at connect time. See [Token storage](#token-storage-cred-references).

## Tool Naming

- MCP tool names are used directly when there's no conflict
- On conflict with built-in or other MCP tools, names are auto-prefixed: `mcp__{server}__{tool}`

## Startup Flow

1. Connect to all configured MCP servers
2. Perform MCP protocol handshake (`initialize`) for each server
3. Discover available tools (`tools/list`)
4. Register tools in the tool registry — the agent uses them like built-in tools
5. Gracefully close all connections on exit

## Plugin Lifecycle Hooks → Context

A plugin can register **lifecycle hooks** that contribute text into the model's
context at well-defined points. Two phases dispatch a contribution today:

- **SessionStart** — fires once on a *cold* session (no prior conversation). The
  contribution is folded in as the first message (e.g. a memory prelude). On a
  resumed session it is skipped (the restored history already carries context).
- **PrePrompt** — fires once per user turn, immediately before the request is
  streamed (e.g. per-turn recall).

The dispatch resolves a hook to an MCP tool of the **same name** on the plugin's
MCP server, calls it, and wraps the result as an *untrusted* block:

```
<plugin-context source="{plugin}:{hook}" trust="untrusted"> … </plugin-context>
```

This block is always a **user-role** message on the volatile tail — it never
enters the system prompt and never shifts the cached system+tools prefix. Tool
output is treated as data, not instructions, and host trust-tag delimiters in
the body are defanged so a backend can't forge host framing. Other phases
(`PostToolUse`, `SessionEnd`, `PreCompact`) are currently log-only.

A plugin binds to a server only when the match is **unambiguous** (exactly one
connected server advertises a tool matching the hook name). If two servers
advertise the same name the binding is refused and the hook stays log-only.

**Kill-switch:** `hooks.dispatch_enabled` (default `true`) disables all hook→
context dispatch when set to `false`, leaving plugins and MCP otherwise intact.

## Plugin MCP Server Home (`~/.genesis`)

Plugin installers write under `~/.genesis` (the *profile home*), and the host
exposes that same root to launched plugin MCP servers so a server can find its
installed assets. The resolution order is:

1. `$GENESIS_PROFILE_HOME` / `$GENESIS_HOME` when set (sandbox / hermetic
   override; ignored if it contains control characters)
2. `~/.genesis` (the cross-platform default)

This is framework-neutral: any plugin that ships an MCP server uses the same
handshake.
