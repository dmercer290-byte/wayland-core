## 1. Layer map

Genesis-Core is a Cargo workspace of ~49 internal `wcore-*` crates plus 5
`genesis-*` plugin crates (54 total). Dependencies flow **downward** in the
diagram below — never introduce circular or upward references. The full
crate table with one-line responsibilities lives in
[AGENTS.md §Crate Map](../AGENTS.md#crate-map).

> The diagram below shows only the **load-bearing spine** plus the substrate
> band — it is not an exhaustive crate listing. For the live, complete set run
> `cargo metadata` or read [AGENTS.md §10](../AGENTS.md#10-project-context--genesis-core).

  Substrate band (peers of the mid tier, grouped by concern — not every
  crate is drawn on the spine above):
    security/sandbox  : wcore-sandbox, wcore-egress, wcore-safety,
                        wcore-permissions
    economics         : wcore-budget, wcore-pricing
    messaging/channels: wcore-channels, wcore-channels-registry, and the
                        wcore-channel-* connectors (discord, email,
                        imessage, matrix, msteams, signal, slack, sms,
                        telegram, whatsapp)
    plugin runtimes   : wcore-plugin-subprocess, wcore-plugin-wasm
    host integration  : wcore-acp, wcore-dispatch, wcore-swarm
    misc              : wcore-cron, wcore-replay, wcore-user-model,
                        wcore-eval-scenarios, wcore-fixture-harness,
                        wcore-honcho-adapter, wcore-agents-pack

  wcore-repomap is a deliberate island — NO internal `wcore-*` deps.

  Plugins (genesis-ollama, genesis-browser, genesis-cua, genesis-ijfw,
  genesis-honcho) sit OFF the main spine. They depend only on
  wcore-plugin-api + wcore-protocol — never on wcore-browser, wcore-cua,
  wcore-mcp, wcore-memory, or wcore-skills directly (audit F2).
```

The mid-tier crates fan out from `wcore-agent` and converge on
`wcore-config` / `wcore-protocol` / `wcore-types` at the bottom. New
functionality must land in the **lowest crate where it semantically
belongs** — see [§4 Where to put new code](#4-where-to-put-new-code).

`wcore-agent` also hosts the **ForgeFlows (Dynamic Workflows)** engine
(`crates/wcore-agent/src/orchestration/workflow/`): declarative RON lowers
to the existing `GraphConfig` IR and executes via `WorkflowRunner` over the
spawner path — see [docs/workflows.md](workflows.md).

## 2. Cross-crate invariants

These rules are load-bearing. Every PR is reviewed against them; several
are mechanically enforced.

| Rule | What it means | Enforced by |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Audit F2** (plugin isolation) | Plugin crates (`genesis-*`) MUST NOT depend on `wcore-browser`, `wcore-cua`, `wcore-mcp`, `wcore-memory`, or `wcore-skills`. They use mirror types from `wcore-plugin-api` instead. `wcore-agent` hosts `HostBrowserRegistrar` / `HostCuaRegistrar` to bind the mirror specs to the real backends without leaking the dep. | `build.rs` lint in `wcore-plugin-api`; Cargo manifest review |
| **`ProviderCompat` discipline** | No hardcoded provider conditionals (`if base_url.contains("api.openai.com")`). Provider differences live in `ProviderCompat` config fields with provider-specific defaults (`openai_defaults()`, `anthropic_defaults()`, etc.). | AGENTS.md §Architecture Principles; clippy + review |
| **Cross-platform shell** | All process spawning goes through `wcore_config::shell` (argv mode for LLM-supplied data, shell-string mode only when shell semantics are the contract). Never `Command::new("sh"/"bash"/"cmd")` directly. | AGENTS.md §Cross-Platform; clippy lint |
| **Observability decoupling** | `wcore-observability` sits between `wcore-types`/`wcore-config` and `wcore-agent`. `wcore-protocol` stays decoupled via opaque `serde_json::Value` payloads — the protocol crate never imports trace types directly. | dep graph; manual review |
| **`wcore-repomap` isolation** | Has NO internal `wcore-*` deps. Re-usable as a standalone library; the Aider-style symbol extractor is intentionally self-contained. | Cargo manifest review |
| **Top-down deps** | New code goes in the LOWEST crate where it semantically belongs. Never copy-paste across crates — extract to the right layer instead. | AGENTS.md §No Duplicate Code |
| **No interpolated shell strings** | In shell-string mode, never `format!`-interpolate LLM-supplied data into the command string. Every such site is a shell injection (the class closed during Wave SA). | Review + the existing audit log |

If you find code that violates an invariant, treat it as a bug. Don't add
a sibling violation to be consistent — fix the original.

## 3. Substrate boundaries

Genesis-Core has **four substrate systems** that overlap conceptually but
remain peers, not subsets. This boundary discipline is locked per the
project rule `feedback-dont-overextend-locked-decisions`: "Memory
substrate = IJFW" applies to **STORAGE only**. Skill curation, GEPA
evolution, and Honcho user-modeling are peer substrates, not subsets of
IJFW or of `wcore-memory`.

### 3.1 IJFW — unified STORAGE substrate

**Scope:** key-value persistence, vector storage, BM25 indexing,
cross-session recall under one consistent API. IJFW is the **bottom-most**
substrate — every other system can use it for durable bytes, but none of
them defer their *domain logic* to it.

**Where it lives:** `.ijfw/` at project root (per-project state) and
`~/.claude/projects/<id>/memory/` (cross-session memory files). The MCP
server `mcp__plugin_ijfw_ijfw-memory__*` exposes the read/write surface.
The `genesis-ijfw` plugin crate is the engine's in-tree anchor — it
exercises every `register_*` surface (tools + hooks + agents + skills +
rules + MCP server) through `wcore-plugin-api` mirror types.

**What IJFW does NOT own:**
- The engine's smart memory tier logic (gate, audit, decay).
- Skills curation, conditional activation, and learning.
- GEPA prompt evolution and child scoring.
- Honcho user-model inference.

Each of those is a peer substrate. IJFW gives them durable bytes; it
does not give them their domain model.

**Anti-pattern:** "since IJFW has vector + BM25 + KV, route every
read/write through `mcp__plugin_ijfw_ijfw-memory__memory_search`." That
collapses the smart layer above into a thin client and loses partition
routing, the gate, the audit log, and the decay scheduler. The engine's
domain types stay in the engine.

### 3.2 wcore-memory — smart MEMORY substrate (above IJFW)

**Scope:** the engine's 5-partition × 3-tier memory model, gate, audit
log, CDC, embedder, dream-cycle consolidation, decay scheduler.

**Relationship to IJFW:** `wcore-memory` MAY use IJFW as a storage
backend for episodic and semantic tiers. It does NOT inherit IJFW's API
surface — the engine's domain types (`MemoryItem`, `Tier`, `Partition`)
are defined in `crates/wcore-memory` and remain stable across storage
backends. Swap IJFW for a different KV/vector store and the
`wcore-memory` public API does not change.

**Anti-pattern:** "since IJFW is the substrate, delete `MemoryItem` and
return IJFW records directly from `wcore-memory`." That couples every
caller to a single backend's serialization. Keep the boundary.

### 3.3 wcore-skills + wcore-evolve + wcore-eval — LEARNING substrate

**Scope:** the engine's procedural intelligence — skill discovery,
curation, conditional activation, GEPA prompt evolution (child
generation, paraphrase mutation, retention), and the eval scoring gate
(precision / recall thresholds).

**Relationship to IJFW and `wcore-memory`:**
- Skill **artifacts** (text bodies, frontmatter, `!shell:` directives)
  live in their own `skills/` directories on disk — bundled in
  `crates/wcore-skills/src/bundled/` and user-installed under
  `~/.genesis/skills/`.
- Skill **telemetry** (usage counts, last-used timestamps, success
  rates) lands in `wcore-memory`'s procedural tier — the memory crate
  is the right home for usage state.
- Evolved prompt **variants** persist in a `prompt_store` owned by
  `wcore-evolve` — sibling-crate to `wcore-memory`, not a subset.

**Anti-pattern:** "fold skills into `wcore-memory` because it also
persists state." Skills have their own lifecycle (load → discover →
condition → execute) that does not match the memory partition model.
Different concerns; different crates.

### 3.4 genesis-honcho — USER-MODELING substrate

**Scope:** Honcho-backed user-model inference. Captures preferences,
history, and inferred attributes ABOUT the user across sessions.

**Relationship to `wcore-memory`:** `wcore-memory` already owns
`partition/p5_user_model` (see
`crates/wcore-memory/tests/p5_user_model_inference.rs`). The Honcho
client populates that partition; it does NOT replace it. Honcho is a
*backend* for user-model facts; the `p5` partition is the engine's
domain model of "things the engine knows about its user," with stable
types that survive a Honcho swap.

**Anti-pattern:** "since Honcho is the user model, delete the p5
partition and call Honcho directly from `wcore-agent`." That collapses
the engine's user-model abstraction into a single vendor's API and
makes the engine unrunnable when Honcho is offline.

```

Each of the four substrates (`wcore-memory`, `wcore-skills` +
`wcore-evolve` + `wcore-eval`, `genesis-honcho`, and IJFW) has its own
API, its own tests, and its own domain types. They **compose**; they do
not subsume each other.

## 4. Where to put new code

| You're adding... | Goes in... |
|------------------|------------|
| A new provider (LLM API surface) | `wcore-providers` + a new `ProviderCompat` preset in `wcore-config` |
| A new built-in tool | `wcore-tools` (registered via `register_tools` in agent bootstrap) |
| A new memory partition or tier | `wcore-memory/src/partition/` or `wcore-memory/src/tier.rs` |
| A new skill | `crates/wcore-skills/src/bundled/` (bundled) or user's `~/.genesis/skills/` |
| A new MCP server consumer | `wcore-mcp` |
| A new plugin (3rd-party LLM, alt tool family, custom hook) | New `genesis-<name>` crate using `wcore-plugin-api` mirror types — no `wcore-browser` / `wcore-cua` / `wcore-mcp` / `wcore-memory` / `wcore-skills` deps |
| A new evaluation metric | `wcore-eval` |
| A new prompt mutator (GEPA) | `wcore-evolve/src/mutator/` |
| A new permission rule | `wcore-permissions` |
| A new channel connector | `wcore-channel-<name>` (register via `wcore-channels-registry`) |
| A new shell sandbox backend | `wcore-sandbox` |
| A new egress / network rule | `wcore-egress` |
| A budget cap or pricing entry | `wcore-budget` / `wcore-pricing` |
| A new observability span / sink | `wcore-observability` |
| A new shell helper or platform-specific path | `wcore-config` (centralize, then call from anywhere) |
| A new JSON stream event type | `wcore-protocol` (and mirror in `wcore-plugin-api` if plugins need it) |
| A new provider-neutral data type | `wcore-types` (only if it's truly shared by 2+ mid-tier crates) |

When in doubt, prefer the lower layer. Functionality at the wrong layer
is the most common source of subsequent refactors.

## 5. Unified WorkspacePolicy

`WorkspacePolicy` (`crates/wcore-tools/src/workspace_policy.rs`) is the
single source of truth for a session's filesystem and network containment.
All sandbox decisions (Bash OS-sandbox manifest, VFS jail) derive from one
policy object, set once at engine bootstrap.

### Two trust modes

| Mode | When | File tools | Bash sandbox | Caches |
|------|------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **`Trusted`** | Local CLI / desktop sessions on the user's own machine | `RealFs` (no jail) | Rooted at workspace; toolchain dirs + global caches readable | Reused from `~/.cargo`, `~/.npm`, etc. — no redirect |
| **`Contained`** | Remote `Workspace` posture | `SandboxedFs ∘ SecretDenyFs` (write-scoped + secret deny) | Rooted at workspace; tight write scope; toolchain read-only | Redirected into `<root>/.wcache/{cargo,npm,pip}` |

Both modes seed network policy from `default_bash_network_policy()`, which
honors the `GENESIS_BASH_ALLOW_NETWORK` env var. Network access is never
hardcoded inside `WorkspacePolicy`.

### Two enforcement adapters

1. **`SandboxManifest`** (`wcore-tools`) — the Bash OS-sandbox adapter.
   `build_sandbox_pieces()` in `bash.rs` accepts an optional `&WorkspacePolicy`
   and derives the `SandboxManifest` (cwd, writable roots, readable roots,
   cache-env injections, network policy, **`fs_read_deny` secret-path deny
   list**) that `wcore-sandbox` enforces on every Bash tool invocation.

2. **VFS jail** (Contained only) — the in-process file-tool adapter.
   `SandboxedFs ∘ SecretDenyFs` wraps `RealFs`: writes outside the workspace
   root are rejected; reads of secret paths (`.env`, `.aws/credentials`, SSH
   keys, TLS certs, Terraform state, service-account JSON, etc.) are denied
   even when the path is inside the workspace.

### Install points

| Where | What | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| `wcore-agent/src/bootstrap.rs` | `WorkspacePolicy::trusted_local(cwd)` installed on every session | Local sessions need sandbox roots without a VFS jail |
| `wcore-agent` `apply_posture` | `WorkspacePolicy::contained(workspace_root)` + `SecretDenyFs` applied | Remote Workspace posture tightens the boundary |

### OS-sandbox secret-read-deny (Implemented)

`WorkspacePolicy` computes a `secret_deny_paths()` list at construction time
(once per session) and populates `SandboxManifest.fs_read_deny`. Every Bash
invocation under a `WorkspacePolicy` passes that list to the OS sandbox, which
enforces read-denial at the kernel level — below any in-process bypass.

**What `fs_read_deny` covers:**
- *User credential stores* (both `Trusted` and `Contained` modes):
  `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.kube`, `~/.docker`, `~/.config/gcloud`,
  `~/.config/gh`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.pgpass`, `~/.git-credentials`,
  and others (see `CREDENTIAL_STORES` in `workspace_policy.rs`).
- *Always-mounted system credential paths* the backends grant
  unconditionally (macOS: `/Library/Keychains`; Linux: `/etc/docker`,
  `/etc/kubernetes`). These are emitted regardless of `readable_roots()`
  because the OS sandbox mounts them by default.
- *Workspace-internal committed secrets* (`Contained` mode only):
  any file under the project root that matches `is_secret_path` (`.env`,
  Terraform state, service-account JSON, TLS certs, etc.).
- *Symlinks whose resolved target is a secret* are denied at the link's
  own path too (second-pass walk).

**Primary boundary:** the allowlist is the true boundary for `$HOME` and
user credential stores — `Contained` posture never mounts `$HOME` at all,
so those files are physically unreadable regardless of any deny rule.
**`fs_read_deny` is load-bearing for:** workspace-internal secrets under the
project root, user credential stores in `Trusted` (local) mode where `$HOME`
is mounted, and the short list of always-mounted system credential paths.
**Network-Deny is the exfil backstop** — even if a secret is read, it cannot
be transmitted outside the allowed egress set.

**Exec-time capability gate:** `SandboxBackend::enforces_read_deny()` reports
`true` only for backends that actually enforce `fs_read_deny` at the OS level
(macOS sandbox-exec, Linux bwrap, Windows AppContainer, Docker with
`live-docker` feature). The authoritative gate lives inside `bash.rs`
`execute_with_ctx` / `execute_streaming_with_ctx` — checked on the same
`default_for_platform()` instance that will run the command (TOCTOU-free). A
bootstrap UX gate in `channel_tools.rs::keep_under` additionally drops `Bash`
from the `Workspace` tool-set when the active backend does not report `true`,
so the model never sees a tool it cannot safely invoke.

**Backend coverage:**

| Backend | Mechanism | `enforces_read_deny()` |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| macOS sandbox-exec | `(deny file-read* (subpath …))` SBPL rules after allows (last-match-wins) | `true` |
| Linux bwrap | `--ro-bind /dev/null <file>` / `--tmpfs <dir>` overlay after positive binds | `true` |
| Windows AppContainer | `DENY_ACCESS` DACL ACE with `SUB_CONTAINERS_AND_OBJECTS_INHERIT` (real impl only; stub stays `false`) | `true` (real) |
| Docker (`live-docker`) | `/dev/null:<path>:ro` bind / empty-dir bind after mounts | `true` |
| `no_sandbox` / `FailClosed` | Not enforced | `false` (default) |

**Residuals (each backstopped by network-Deny):**

1. **Hardlinks to a secret** — path-based deny is inode-blind on Linux and
   macOS (the deny covers the enumerated path, not the inode). Windows
   AppContainer shares the Security Descriptor across hard links, so it is
   covered there.
2. **Symlink whose resolved target is an external secret not itself
   enumerated** — reachable via the always-on `/etc` / `/Library` system
   mounts. The deny covers the link's own path when its target is in the
   enumerated list; a target beyond that list is a DAC + network-Deny
   residual (the agent-user may own the target file, so DAC alone is not
   sufficient).
3. **Secret created after the cached per-session walk** (including
   out-of-band writes by a parallel build process) — the walk runs once at
   policy construction; files added later in the session are not covered.
   This is wider than a per-command walk would be, and is the price of the
   performance fix (Task 6).
4. **Broad always-on system mounts beyond enumerated credential paths** —
   `fs_read_deny` covers the known high-value paths within `/etc`, `/Library`,
   `/System`, `/usr`; it does not claim to deny every file under those trees.
   DAC + network-Deny contain the remainder.

### Deferred follow-ups

1. **MCP child-process coverage** — MCP stdio servers launched inside a
   Workspace posture inherit the parent environment but are not yet subject
   to the `WorkspacePolicy` sandbox manifest.
