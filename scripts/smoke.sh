# smoke.sh — genesis-core P0 SMOKE GATE (pre-release).
#
# Runs the live P0 smoke suite from
# .planning/audit/UX-AUDIT-AND-TEST-PLAN.md §4 — the ordered checks a new user
# hits in the first ten minutes. A release is BLOCKED if any HARD-GATE check
# fails. The original SMOKE §4 rule named 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 as
# the aspirational gate; only the checks that EXIST as tests are enforced here.
# Implemented + enforced today: 6, 10, 17, 24. Interactive-pending (reported,
# not enforced): 15, 22, 23. Uncovered TODO (NOT claimed as covered, pending
# their wave): 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 18, 19. See the table in smoke_p0.rs's module
# doc for the per-check status.
#
# The checks live as Rust integration tests in
#   crates/wcore-cli/tests/smoke_p0.rs
# split into two classes:
#   1. engine-behavior checks (default lane, run hermetically against the mock)
#   2. GAP checks + interactive-pending checks (#[ignore]'d; run with
#      --run-ignored so they are REPORTED, never silently skipped)
#
# The seven currently-RED GAP checks (D002, D009, D010, D011, D012, D013, D015)
# are EXPECTED to fail today — they prove the coverage gaps exist. This runner
# reports them as RED/uncovered and does NOT count their failure toward the hard
# gate yet (they are gated in once their remediation wave lands). The hard gate
# is the set of engine-behavior + interactive checks that must be GREEN to ship.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/smoke.sh            # run the gate (hermetic, mock provider)
#   scripts/smoke.sh --help
#   SMOKE_LIVE=1 ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... scripts/smoke.sh   # + 1 real turn
#
# Exit: 0 if every HARD-GATE check passed; non-zero otherwise.

smoke.sh — genesis-core P0 smoke gate

USAGE
  scripts/smoke.sh

WHAT IT DOES
  Runs crates/wcore-cli/tests/smoke_p0.rs:
    · engine-behavior checks #6/#10/#17/#24 (hermetic, mock provider) — MUST be
      green; these are the only implemented hard-gate checks
    · GAP checks D002/D009/D010/D011/D012/D013/D015 — currently RED (reported,
      not gated yet; they prove the 7 P0 coverage gaps exist)
    · interactive-pending checks (#15 AskUser arrows, #22 ?-help, #23 @-Tab) —
      reported as interactive-pending, not silently skipped
    · checks #7/#8/#9/#11/#14/#18/#19 — uncovered TODO, no test yet (NOT run,
      NOT claimed as covered; land with their remediation waves)

ENV
  SMOKE_LIVE=1 + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...   also run the single real-key turn
  WCORE_TEST_RUNNER=cargo|nextest           override the test runner

EXIT
  0   every HARD-GATE check passed
  >0  a HARD-GATE check failed (release blocked)
