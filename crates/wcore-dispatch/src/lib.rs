//! `wcore-dispatch` — internal decision router for Genesis-Core.
//!
//! This crate selects *templates*, *agents*, and *skills* given task
//! context. It is NOT a model router (that lives in Flux as a separate
//! product). The router learns from observed outcomes via a Thompson-
//! sampling Beta scorer; every choice the router makes can be fed back
//! with [`TaskOutcome`] to update the posterior for future selections.
//!
//! # Layering
