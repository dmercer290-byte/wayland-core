//! v0.6.5 Task 2.7 — WASM plugin host end-to-end smoke.
//!
//! ## E2E approach
//!
//! Full component-model round-trip (host instantiates a real `.wasm`
//! component, invokes the `tool.execute` export, and gets a response
//! back through the host imports) requires either:
//!   1. A `cargo-component` build step in CI (Task 4.4's plan).
//!   2. A hand-written WAT component that imports `genesis:host/host` —
//!      WAT component-model syntax is large and brittle to author inline.
//!
//! For Task 2.7 we ship the **PLACEHOLDER** path per the task brief: a
//! smoke test that exercises everything UP TO real component dispatch,
//! deferring the round-trip to Task 4.4's `.wasm` fixture. This proves:
//!   - `WasmPluginRunner::new()` builds an engine.
//!   - `WasmPluginRunner::load_from_bytes` rejects malformed bytes with
//!     the documented `LoadFailed` error (not a panic, not a stub).
//!   - `LoadedWasmPlugin::call_tool` is callable on the placeholder path
//!     and returns the documented `ExecuteFailed("not yet wired (Task 2.7…)")`
//!     surface — the dispatch seam compiles end-to-end.
//!
//! ## TODO Task 4.4
//!
//! Replace this file with a real component fixture: a 5-LOC Rust
//! tool plugin compiled to `target/wasm32-wasi/release/echo.wasm`
//! via `cargo-component`, loaded here, and round-tripped through
//! the host imports. The fixture lives under
//! `crates/wcore-plugin-wasm/tests/fixtures/echo-plugin/` and is built
//! by the `wasm-fixtures` CI job.
