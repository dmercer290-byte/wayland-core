//! Knowledge-graph substrate for semantic memory (T2-D1).
//!
//! # Status: WIRED (v0.6.3 — W2 + W5)
//!
//! Schema, BFS, node/edge upsert, and `kg_enabled()` all work. `init_kg`
//! runs in `AgentBootstrap::build()` on the production Memory instance
//! (gated by `kg_enabled()`), and the fact-extraction pipeline (W5) upserts
//! nodes/edges at session/turn end. The `GENESIS_KG=off` rollback flag
//! disables KG init.
//!
//! Sibling to `propagation.rs` (session-lineage forest) — NO shared abstraction.
//! Tables `kg_nodes` and `kg_edges` are additive on the existing memory database.
//!
//! Concepts ported from IJFW v1.3.0 D-pillar (extract.js + traverse.js):
//!   - Nodes carry `(name, kind)` with UNIQUE composite key.
//!   - Edges are `(src, dst, kind, weight)` with PK on the triple.
//!   - BFS reads kg_edges in BOTH directions (undirected at the read layer)
//!     and caps depth + visited count.
//!
//! Rollback: set `GENESIS_KG=off` (callers gate `kg::init` on this env var)
//! to skip KG creation and bfs operations.
//! Migration: `schema::init()` is idempotent — safe to run on existing
//! memory dbs. Not auto-called from `apply_migrations`; consumers opt in.
