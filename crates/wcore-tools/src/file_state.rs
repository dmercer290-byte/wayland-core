//! T3-3.2.3 — Cross-agent file state coordination registry.
//!
//! Ported from the prior Genesis Python engine. Prevents
//! mangled edits when concurrent subagents (same process, same
//! filesystem) touch the same file. Complements the single-agent
//! [`crate::file_cache::FileStateCache`] — that module is a per-process
//! LRU content cache keyed by resolved path, while this module is a
//! per-process *coordinator* that tracks WHO read/wrote a path and WHEN,
//! and exposes per-path locks for read→modify→write critical sections.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! A process-wide singleton [`FileStateRegistry`] tracks, per resolved
//! path:
//!
//! * Per-agent read stamps: `{task_id: {path: (mtime_ms, read_ts_ms, partial)}}`
//! * Last writer globally: `{path: (task_id, write_ts_ms)}`
//! * Per-path [`std::sync::Mutex`] for read→modify→write sections.
//!
//! Public hooks (all no-ops when the env var
//! `GENESIS_DISABLE_FILE_STATE_GUARD=1` is set):
//!
//! * [`record_read`] — call after every read.
//! * [`note_write`] — call after every successful write/patch.
//! * [`check_stale`] — call BEFORE every write/patch; returns a model-
//!   facing warning string when the write would clobber another agent's
//!   work, otherwise `None`.
//! * [`lock_path`] — RAII guard that serializes other lockers of the
//!   same path (different paths proceed in parallel).
//! * [`writes_since`] — used by the delegate-completion reminder to
//!   surface sibling writes to the parent agent.
//! * [`known_reads`] — list of paths an agent has read.
//!
//! ## Divergence from Python source
//!
//! * Time stamps are integer milliseconds since `UNIX_EPOCH` (`u128`),
//!   not floating-point seconds — avoids monotonic-vs-wall confusion
//!   and `f64` rounding when comparing closely-spaced events. The
//!   semantic (an opaque ordered timestamp) is unchanged.
//! * The Python source uses `collections.defaultdict` insertion order
//!   for the LRU-style cap. We use [`indexmap`]-free equivalent: a
//!   plain [`HashMap`] paired with a `VecDeque` of insertion order so
//!   the oldest entry is dropped on overflow. Behavior matches.
//! * `lock_path` is an RAII guard (`LockGuard`) instead of a context
//!   manager — same semantics: acquire on construction, release on
//!   drop.
//! * `clear()` is gated on `#[cfg(test)]` — production code should
//!   never reset the registry.
