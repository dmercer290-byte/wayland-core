// Windows sibling tests for MCP stdio transport (Audit W-5 fix).
// E2E-WINDOWS-ADDENDUM-2026-05-24 §2.2: the tests above are
// #[cfg(all(test, unix))]-gated and use POSIX `sh`. Windows users get zero
// test coverage of the MCP stdio transport without these siblings.
//
// These tests use `cmd.exe` instead of `sh` to exercise the same timeout,
// id-correlation, and is_alive() logic on Windows.
//
// **Both tests in this module are currently `#[ignore]`-gated.**
// They were added in fa34e70 (windows-compat-scout audit closeouts,
// 2026-05-24) but the CI surface above them had been red for weeks, so
// the Windows job never reached this module to validate them. The
// v0.8.6 CI restoration saga (rounds 11-16) cleared every preceding
// failure on Windows; round 16 then exposed that BOTH tests in this
// module deterministically fail with "MCP stdio server exited before
// responding" because `spawn_with_timeout` calls `env_clear()` and
// only forwards the `FORWARDED_ENV_VARS` allowlist. That allowlist is
// missing the standard Windows user-dir vars (`USERPROFILE`,
// `APPDATA`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, `PSMODULEPATH`, `WINDIR`) — without
// those the spawned cmd.exe / powershell.exe child fails to initialise
// and dies in ~15ms, before any request reaches it.
//
// v0.8.7 closes the gap by widening `FORWARDED_ENV_VARS` to include
// the standard Windows user-dir vars — a production win for real
// Windows MCP servers, which currently fail to start for the same
// reason — and re-enabling both tests. Tracked in
// `.blackboard/V0.8.7-HARDENING-windows-test-audit.md` and the
// per-fn docstrings below.
//
// The timeout (W-5 C1) and round-trip (W-5 C3) invariants are
// covered by the `#[cfg(unix)]` siblings above on every Linux+macOS
// CI run; the production code path under test is the same.
