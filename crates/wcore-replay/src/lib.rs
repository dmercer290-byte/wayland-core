//! M5.2 — session trace replay + diff for genesis-core.
//!
//! Three primitives that close the "what did the session actually do?"
//! debugging loop:
//!
//! - [`Trace`] / [`TraceEvent`] — agent-flow events serialized to JSON
//! - [`Replayer`] — load + version-skew-guarded dry-run of a trace
//! - [`Differ`] — side-by-side compare of two traces with
//!   [`DiffKind::Added`] / [`Removed`] / [`Changed`] / [`Unchanged`]
//!
//! In-process LLM rehydration (re-running a trace against a real
//! provider) is intentionally out of scope for v0.6 — that surface lives
//! in `wcore-agent` and is gated behind a future feature flag. The value
//! this crate ships is the schema + the version-skew guard + the diff
//! entrypoint, which is the load-bearing piece for debugging.
