//! Profile-supervisor seam for the ACP transports (persona-profiles PR-7).
//!
//! `wcore-acp` is a mid-layer transport crate and MUST NOT depend on the
//! process/spawn machinery, the profile store, or an ACP client pool. The
//! supervisor is reached through this transport-neutral trait, implemented in
//! `wcore-cli` exactly like [`crate::turn::TurnEngine`], [`crate::a2a::A2aHandler`]
//! and [`crate::roster::AgentRoster`]. Keeps the crate dependency-free while the
//! CLI layer owns process lifecycle.
//!
//! # What this is (and the invariant it enforces)
//!
//! An in-process persona overlay (PR-4') and a per-PROFILE agent are two
//! DIFFERENT mechanisms. A persona shares this process's single
//! credential/home identity; a `profile:<name>` agent is a SEPARATE PROCESS
//! (`wcore acp serve --profile <name>`) with its OWN `GENESIS_HOME` ⇒ own
//! keys/.env/memory/SOUL. One profile per process is the ONLY safe topology —
//! N profiles in one address space is the credential-bleed the red-team
//! rejected (shared `GENESIS_HOME`/`*_API_KEY`/egress globals). The router
//! therefore never resolves a profile to an in-process overlay; it spawns/routes
//! to that profile's child.
//!
//! # Hard requirements on any implementation
//!   * **One child = one profile = one identity.** Never multiplex profiles.
//!   * **Fail closed.** An invalid/absent profile ([`crate::error::AcpError`]
//!     from `profile_dir`, or a missing home dir) MUST error — NEVER fall
//!     through to this process's default home (that is the cross-write
//!     corruption `json_stream_profile_guard` exists to prevent).
//!   * **No secrets cross the wire.** The router routes JSON-RPC to a localhost
//!     child; a profile's home path, model, provider, or key is never surfaced
//!     through [`crate::protocol::AgentInfo`] (that stays id + label only, R4).
//!   * **Authz-gated + default-OFF.** The server only consults a router for a
//!     session whose create-time `agent` was AUTHORIZED by the roster, and only
//!     when the operator enabled the supervisor feature.
