//! Canonical trace schema for the agent loop. Serializes to stable JSON.
//!
//! Hierarchy:
//!
//! ```text
//! ExecutionTrace (session-scoped; W6 aggregates)
//!   └── TurnTrace (one per turn; W1 emits over the protocol stream)
//!         └── ToolCallTrace (one per tool call within the turn)
//! ```
//!
//! Every trace tags itself with `source_product = SOURCE_PRODUCT` (S5) so
//! future memory-fusion code can attribute records to the engine that
//! produced them.
//!
//! # Result-snippet capture
//!
//! `ToolCallTrace::with_result_snippet` captures the first
//! [`RESULT_SNIPPET_MAX`] bytes of a tool call's result. This is gated by
//! the `GENESIS_TRACE_RESULT_SNIPPETS` env var: capture is ON by default;
//! setting the var to (case-insensitive) `off`, `0`, or `false` disables
//! it, leaving `result_snippet` as `None`. Mirrors the
//! `kg_enabled()` / `staleness_enabled()` opt-out convention.
