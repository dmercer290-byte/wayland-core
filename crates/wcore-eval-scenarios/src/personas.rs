//! Lane B "overnight persona" scenarios — plan: `.planning/2026-06-04-e2e-and-wiring-masterplan.md`.
//!
//! These drive the REAL `genesis-core` binary against the real DeepSeek
//! provider through complete persona journeys and judge the AGENT BY THE
//! ARTIFACTS it produces (file exists / parses / contains the brief), the way
//! a real customer would judge it — not by whether a particular tool fired.
//!
//! ## Customer-realism (the design bar)
//!
//! Real customers do NOT say "Create a file `x.py` and use the Write tool."
//! They state an *outcome* in domain terms ("I'm opening a coffee shop — build
//! me a landing page"), leave the tooling to the agent, then *refine* and
//! *correct* across turns ("the button should say 'Order Online' — fix that").
//! So these personas:
//!   - open with a vague, domain-framed ask (the agent must pick Write/Bash/web itself),
//!   - assert on the ARTIFACT and on whether the agent incorporated the brief
//!     (`FileContains "Ember"` proves it used my ask, not a generic template),
//!   - include a correction turn and assert the correction LANDED
//!     (`FileContains "Order Online"`),
//!   - only pin a specific tool where the tool *is* the point (researcher must
//!     hit the `web` tool; coder must actually `Bash`-run the program). Update
//!     turns assert artifacts only, since Write-vs-Edit is the agent's call.
//!
//! Filenames are still named naturally in the prompt ("save it as index.html")
//! so the artifact assertions stay deterministic — real users do say where to
//! put things.
//!
//! ## Scope: built-in tools only
//!
//! Every persona here is satisfiable with the engine's built-in tool surface
//! (`Write`, `Read`, `Edit`, `Bash`, `web`, `Grep`, `Glob`). The richer
//! artifact personas in the masterplan catalog — Writer→**PDF**, Analyst→**chart
//! image** — need the artifact-gen SKILLs (LibreOffice / matplotlib, masterplan
//! Batch 3) that don't exist yet; adding them now would only produce flaky
//! FAILs that say nothing about the engine. The `writer` persona below covers
//! long-form generation in Markdown (the in-scope slice); its PDF export lands
//! once the `pdf-report` skill does.
