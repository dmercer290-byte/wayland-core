//! D8 — PTY-based TUI capture driver.
//!
//! The json-stream runner ([`crate::runner`]) drives `genesis-core` in its
//! machine-facing `--json-stream` mode over plain pipes. This module instead
//! drives the binary in its **interactive ratatui TUI** mode under a real
//! pseudo-terminal, sends keystrokes the way a human keyboard would, and
//! captures what the terminal actually renders so eval scenarios can assert on
//! the *rendered screen* — not on a wire protocol.
//!
//! ## Why a PTY
//!
//! `genesis-core` only launches its full-screen TUI when
//! `IsTerminal::is_terminal(&stdout())` is true AND no prompt / `--no-tui` /
//! `--json-stream` was given (`wcore-cli/src/main.rs` `tui_capable` gate). A
//! plain piped subprocess fails that check and falls through to the line-based
//! REPL, so only a PTY exercises the real UI. We therefore spawn with NO extra
//! mode flags — the bare binary on a PTY IS the TUI.
//!
//! ## Hermeticity
//!
//! Reuses [`crate::tempenv`] exactly like the json-stream runner: a throwaway
//! tempdir holds a seeded `.genesis-core/config.toml` (absolute session dir per
//! cross-audit C-3, plus the provider id/model/key), the binary is spawned with
//! `cwd = env.path()`, and `GENESIS_HOME` is pointed at the tempdir so
//! `wcore_config::genesis_config_dir()` resolves the seeded config on every
//! platform (matching `wcore-cli/tests/harness_tui_flow.rs`). Ambient provider
//! keys are stripped so a test never makes a hidden network call.
//!
//! ## Screen capture & assertions
//!
//! A reader thread pumps the master PTY's raw byte stream into a
//! [`vt100::Parser`], which applies every ANSI sequence the binary emits and
//! yields a rendered screen grid. [`PtyCapture::screen_text`] returns that grid
//! as plain text (ANSI already resolved), so substring assertions
//! ([`PtyCapture::assert_screen_contains`] / [`PtyCapture::screen_contains`])
//! match on human-visible anchors, never on escape codes.
//!
//! ## Dependencies
//!
//! `portable-pty` and `vt100` are NOT currently dependencies of
//! `wcore-eval-scenarios` (they ARE direct deps of `wcore-cli`, so both are
//! already in the workspace lockfile). To compile this module, add to
//! `crates/wcore-eval-scenarios/Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # D8 PTY TUI-capture driver. Same versions wcore-cli already pins
//! # (vt100 stays at 0.15 — 0.16 wants unicode-width ^0.2.1 which
//! # collides with ratatui 0.29's pinned unicode-width =0.2.0).
//! portable-pty = "0.9"
//! vt100        = "0.15"
//! ```
//!
//! Both are direct (registry) deps, not `{ workspace = true }` — they are not
//! declared in `[workspace.dependencies]`, only inline in `wcore-cli`.
//!
//! ## Platform
//!
//! Unix-only. `portable_pty`'s Windows ConPTY backend does not surface the
//! spawned binary's stdout to the master end in headless CI (the vt100 parser
//! stays empty and every wait hits its timeout), exactly as documented in
//! `wcore-cli/tests/harness_tui_flow.rs`. The module is gated `#[cfg(unix)]`.

/// STUBBED ON PURPOSE. The D8 core deliverable is reliable PTY capture + text
/// assertions (above); pixel screenshots are a nice-to-have and pull in an
/// extra rendering dependency, so they are deferred behind this clearly-marked
/// seam rather than half-implemented.
///
/// To implement: render the [`vt100::Screen`] grid (each cell's char + fg/bg
/// from `vt100`'s SGR state) into an RGBA image using a monospace font and the
/// `image` crate, then PNG-encode. A turnkey path is the `vt100-image`-style
/// approach — add a font rasteriser (`fontdue` or `rusttype`) + `image` as
/// dependencies and walk `screen.cell(row, col)`.
///
/// Returns an explicit "not implemented" error (never `todo!()`, which the
/// crate-wide `#![deny(clippy::todo)]` forbids) so a caller that wires this up
/// before the renderer exists gets an honest signal, not a panic.
