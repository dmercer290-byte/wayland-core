//! D7 — hook-fixture scenarios.
//!
//! These exercise genesis-core's **lifecycle hooks** (the `[[hooks.*]]`
//! config surface in `wcore-config::hooks`) through the real binary, end to
//! end. Two guarantees are covered:
//!
//!   1. A `pre_tool_use` hook that exits non-zero **blocks** the matched
//!      mutating tool — the engine substitutes a `Blocked by hook: …` tool
//!      result and the write never lands. `FileAbsent` proves enforcement.
//!   2. A `stop` hook fires when the session ends and leaves an observable
//!      filesystem artifact. `FileExists` proves the hook ran.
//!
//! # Hook block-contract (verified against source, not docs)
//!
//! `wcore-config/src/hooks.rs::ShellHooks::run_pre_tool_use` runs each matching
//! `pre_tool_use` hook's `command` as a child process and, on
//! `!status.success()` (i.e. any **non-zero exit code**), returns
//! `HookError::Blocked { hook_name, output }`. `docs/advanced.md` §"Hook
//! System": *"`pre_tool_use` — Before tool execution — Non-zero exit blocks the
//! tool."* The agent side
//! (`wcore-agent/src/orchestration/mod.rs:578-584`) catches that error and
//! emits a synthetic tool result with `content = "Blocked by hook: {reason}"`
//! INSTEAD of executing the tool — so a blocked `Write`/`Bash` produces no file.
//!
//! `stop` hooks run via `ShellHooks::run_stop`
//! (`engine.rs::run_stop_hooks`) at session end; they are non-blocking and
//! ignore exit code, so the assertion is purely "did the side effect happen".
//!
//! # Matching
//!
//! `tool_match` is a glob list over the tool NAME (empty = all). `file_match`
//! is a glob list over the tool's `file_path` input (empty = all). Env vars
//! `${TOOL_NAME}`, `${TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH}`, `${TOOL_INPUT_COMMAND}` are
//! interpolated into `command` before execution.
//!
//! ===========================================================================
//! WIRING NEEDED (the harness cannot run these as-is — two seams must close):
//! ===========================================================================
//!
//! ## (A) The runner must INVOKE `scenario.setup` before spawning the binary.
//!
//! As of this commit, `Scenario::setup` stores a closure but NOTHING in
//! `runner.rs` ever calls it (verified: the only reference to `.setup` in
//! `src/` is the builder assignment). Without this, the hook config below is
//! never written and BOTH scenarios silently degrade (the agent just writes
//! the file → false FAIL on #1, no artifact → FAIL on #2). In
//! `runner.rs::run_session_in`, immediately AFTER the working dir exists and
//! BEFORE `spawn_for_run`, add:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! if let Some(setup) = &scenario.setup {
//!     setup(cwd).map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("scenario setup failed: {e}"))?;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! (Symmetrically, call `scenario.cleanup` on the way out if desired — not
//! required for D7.)
//!
//! ## (B) The hook config must land in the file tempenv ALREADY wrote.
//!
//! `tempenv::build` writes `<cwd>/.genesis-core/config.toml` (DIR form) with
//! the absolute `[session].directory` + provider key. `config.rs`
//! `project_config_path()` PREFERS `.genesis-core.toml` (FILE form) when BOTH
//! exist (F-011). Therefore `setup()` must **append** the `[[hooks.*]]` blocks
//! to the EXISTING dir-form file — creating the file form would shadow it and
//! drop the session dir + key. The `append_hooks_config` helper below does
//! exactly that (open-append `<cwd>/.genesis-core/config.toml`).
//!
//! No `tempenv.rs` change is needed: the project-level config in cwd is read
//! by the engine's normal cwd-walk, and `merge_config` concatenates
//! `project.hooks.pre_tool_use` / `.stop` into the effective config
//! (`config.rs:1939-1941`). This is the preferred path — it requires no
//! `TempEnvOptions` extension.
//!
//! If (A) is judged out of scope for this crate's runner, an alternative is to
//! teach `tempenv::build_with` a `hooks_toml: Option<String>` option and write
//! it inline — but that edits `tempenv.rs`, which (A) avoids.
