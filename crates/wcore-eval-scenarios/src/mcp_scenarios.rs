//! D6 — MCP round-trip scenarios.
//!
//! Exercises a full MCP stdio round-trip through the REAL `genesis-core`
//! binary: the engine connects to a mock stdio MCP server, performs the
//! `initialize` / `tools/list` handshake, the model calls the advertised
//! `mcp_echo` tool, and we assert the call fired AND a sentinel string
//! round-tripped back through the tool result.
//!
//! ## Why a python script (not a cargo bin)
//!
//! The mock server is a self-contained `python3` script (stdlib only,
//! ~80 lines). `python3` resolves on every CI runner and dev box this
//! suite targets; a cargo bin target would need workspace wiring we are
//! explicitly not touching. The [`Scenario::setup`] hook writes the
//! script into the scenario tempdir at runtime and `chmod +x`'s it.
//!
//! ## How the engine discovers the server (config wiring)
//!
//! genesis-core reads MCP servers ONLY from `[mcp.servers.*]` in
//! `config.toml` (`wcore-config/src/config.rs` `McpConfig` /
//! `McpServerConfig`; there is NO project-level `.mcp.json` reader — grep
//! confirmed). `tempenv::build` seeds `<cwd>/.genesis-core/config.toml`
//! BEFORE the setup hook runs and the runner spawns the binary with
//! `cwd = tempdir`, so the setup hook simply **APPENDS** an
//! `[mcp.servers.mock_echo]` block to that already-seeded file. This needs
//! NO change to `tempenv.rs`.
//!
//! The appended block (values filled in at runtime with absolute paths):
//!
//! ```toml
//! [mcp.servers.mock_echo]
//! transport = "stdio"
//! command = "python3"
//! args = ["<tempdir>/mock_mcp_server.py"]
//! deferred = false
//! ```
//!
//! Field semantics (verified against `McpServerConfig`):
//!   - `transport = "stdio"` → launch a subprocess, talk JSON-RPC over its
//!     stdin/stdout. `TransportType` is `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]`
//!     so the literal string is `"stdio"`.
//!   - `command` / `args` → the program + argv. We pass `python3` as the
//!     command and the absolute script path as the sole arg.
//!   - `deferred = false` → **critical**. MCP tools default to
//!     `deferred = true`, which registers them as name-only stubs the model
//!     must first discover via `ToolSearch`. Setting `false` sends the full
//!     `mcp_echo` schema eagerly so a single-turn prompt can call it
//!     directly and deterministically.
//!
//! ## Tool name in the trace
//!
//! `mcp_echo` does not collide with any built-in tool, so the MCP proxy
//! registers it under its ORIGINAL name `mcp_echo` (collision would prefix
//! it to `mcp__mock_echo__mcp_echo` — see
//! `wcore-mcp/src/tool_proxy.rs::register_mcp_tools`). The trace's
//! `tool_name` is therefore `mcp_echo`, which is what `expect_tool` and the
//! `TraceAssertion` count against.
//!
//! ## WIRING NEEDED (lib.rs only — no tempenv change)
//!
//! Add to `crates/wcore-eval-scenarios/src/lib.rs`:
//! ```ignore
//! pub mod mcp_scenarios;
//! ```
//! and, if the binary aggregates scenario lists, fold `mcp_scenarios::all()`
//! into the master vec the same way `qa::all()` is folded. No `tempenv.rs`,
//! `runner.rs`, `scenario.rs`, or `Cargo.toml` edit is required — the setup
//! hook does all the per-run wiring.
