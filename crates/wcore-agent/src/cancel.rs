//! W8a A.2 — cooperative cancellation primitives.
//!
//! Thin re-export of `tokio_util::sync::CancellationToken` with helpers
//! used by `ToolContext.cancel` (A.3) and by `bash`/`script`/`mcp` tools
//! that race `ctx.cancel.cancelled()` against their long work (A.4).
//!
//! Wave RC (audit MAJOR #8) — [`budget_linked`] /
//! [`budget_linked_with_callback`] return a [`BudgetGuard`] RAII handle
//! that aborts the spawned 50ms-poll task on drop. Previously the
//! watcher task was self-documented as leaking for the lifetime of the
//! session; at the dozen-tasks scale of a single genesis-core process
//! that was tolerable, but a host that recycles sessions thousands of
//! times per hour (e.g. genesis Electron running many short-lived
//! protocol streams) would accumulate idle pollers. The guard makes
//! the lifetime explicit: when the caller drops the guard, the watcher
//! is aborted and the underlying token reference is released.
