//! Channel tool posture enforcement.
//!
//! A channel-originated agent turn runs a real [`AgentEngine`] on the host.
//! The sender is REMOTE, so that engine must NOT inherit the local CLI's
//! full host access — otherwise an (allowlisted-but-untrusted, or
//! compromised) chat user could `Read`/`Grep` host secrets and have the
//! reply ship them back. This module maps a per-channel
//! [`ChannelToolPosture`] onto a concrete, reduced toolset:
//!
//! - **Conversational** (default): drop every built-in host filesystem /
//!   shell tool. Keep only the fail-closed [`CONVERSATIONAL_SAFE`] allowlist
//!   (conversational + network tools) plus operator-wired MCP tools.
//! - **Workspace**: as Conversational, but add the vfs-jailable filesystem
//!   tools ([`WORKSPACE_FS_TOOLS`]) back and pin a [`SandboxedFs`] jail on
//!   the registry so they cannot escape the configured workspace root.
//!   `Bash` is additionally gated on the active sandbox backend enforcing
//!   secret-read-deny (`read_deny_enforced` param to `apply_posture` /
//!   `keep_under`) — without that OS-layer guarantee, `cat .env` would
//!   bypass `SecretDenyFs`. The exec-time gate in `bash.rs` is the
//!   authoritative boundary; this UX drop prevents advertising a tool that
//!   would always refuse.
//! - **Full**: no jail, and every tool kept EXCEPT the unconfined-search
//!   built-ins `Grep`/`Glob` ([`FULL_CHANNEL_DENY`]) — their recursive scan
//!   shells out past `ctx.vfs`, so a channel sender could read project
//!   secrets `SecretDenyFs` already denies to Read/Write/Edit. A LOCAL CLI
//!   Full session is unaffected (it has no scope, so `apply_posture` never
//!   runs); only channel/remote Full drops them.
//!
//! Enforcement is at the [`ToolRegistry`] (not just the LLM schema): a
//! dropped tool is un-dispatchable, so even a hallucinated call cannot
//! reach it.
//!
//! [`AgentEngine`]: crate::engine::AgentEngine
//! [`SandboxedFs`]: wcore_tools::vfs::SandboxedFs
