//! Wave OR (W8b.2.B.1) — `AgentNodeExecutor` production adapter.
//!
//! This is the bridge that wakes up the [`super::graph::ExecutionGraph`]
//! machinery in the engine's per-turn loop. The graph's `NodeExecutor`
//! trait is called once per `AgentCall` node; the adapter routes each
//! call back through the existing tool-dispatch pipeline
//! (`execute_tool_calls_with_budget` / `_with_approval`), preserving
//! confirmation, hooks, streaming, budget tracking, and cancellation.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in its own module
//!
//! `orchestration/mod.rs` already exceeds 1200 lines. Keeping the
//! adapter here also makes the dependency edge obvious: this is the
//! ONLY production-side `NodeExecutor` impl; tests script the trait
//! directly.
//!
//! ## Why `Arc<ToolRegistry>` everywhere
//!
//! `ExecutionGraph::execute` spawns each parallel `AgentCall` via
//! `tokio::spawn`, which imposes `'static + Send + Sync` on the
//! executor. The adapter therefore must hold owned/Arc state — not a
//! borrowed `&ToolRegistry`. Wave OR's bounded refactor wraps the
//! engine's registry in `Arc<ToolRegistry>` so the adapter can clone
//! the handle cheaply per turn without copying the tool list.
//!
//! ## Per-turn mutable state
//!
//! `HookEngine` is owned by the engine (`Option<HookEngine>`) and is
//! mutated during dispatch (post-tool-use outcomes, log-line drains).
//! We move it into the adapter via `Arc<tokio::sync::Mutex<...>>` for
//! the duration of the graph walk and move it back when the walk
//! completes. The lock is single-tasked on the Direct path (one
//! `AgentCall` node) and is short-held inside `run_agent` (each tool
//! call's pre/post hooks run inside the lock guard). For parallel
//! templates that use the production adapter the lock serialises
//! hook access across sibling agents — acceptable because hooks are
//! not the hot path.
//!
//! ## What input/output the executor sees
//!
//! The graph passes `Value` as input/output. For the Direct template
//! the input is the engine's tool-call batch serialised into a JSON
//! object; the output is the merged `ToolCallOutcome` serialised back.
//! `engine::run` extracts the outcome from the executor's per-turn
//! shared cell (`outcome_slot`) rather than parsing the JSON — the
//! `Value` is a graph-level shape carrier; `outcome_slot` is the
//! load-bearing path. This duality is intentional: the graph stays
//! type-erased (so non-engine executors work in tests) while the
//! engine adapter keeps full structured types end-to-end.
