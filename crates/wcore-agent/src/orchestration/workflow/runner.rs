//! A3 — `WorkflowRunner`: executes a lowered [`GraphConfig`] by walking it
//! in dependency order and dispatching each `AgentCall` through the
//! [`AgentSpawner`] path: `spawn_one` for a linear chain;
//! `spawn_parallel_with_per_task_extras` for a fan-out up to
//! [`FLEET_FANOUT_THRESHOLD`] siblings (per-task `ChannelSink` relay); and
//! `spawn_via_fleet` (real `FleetDispatcher` sharding) for any wider fan-out.
//!
//! ## Why a separate executor (not the walker)
//!
//! The per-turn `ExecutionGraph::execute` walker (`orchestration/graph.rs`)
//! is **inert for multi-agent work**: the engine's first-dispatch-wins guard
//! (`orchestration/node_executor.rs:202-207`) limits a turn to one real
//! `AgentCall`. `WorkflowRunner` runs **outside** the engine's per-turn
//! one-batch contract — each `spawn_one` builds a fresh `AgentEngine` with its
//! own turn loop, so all stages run for real. This is the assumption
//! `tests/workflow_runner_spike.rs` proved; this module generalises that
//! kernel from a flat sequence to an arbitrary lowered `GraphConfig`.
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! 1. Maintains a `serde_json::Value` object as the running state.
//! 2. Walks nodes in topological order (Kahn over the edge set), entry first.
//!    Nodes that become ready in the same wave and are sibling `AgentCall`s
//!    (a fan-out sharing a predecessor) are dispatched **concurrently**; a
//!    linear chain naturally resolves one node per wave (sequential).
//! 3. For each `AgentCall`: resolve the node's `InputMapper` against the
//!    current state, build a `SubAgentConfig` whose prompt is the authored
//!    node prompt with the resolved input injected, dispatch, then write
//!    `result.text` onto `state[node_id]`.
//! 4. `Aggregator` nodes fold their inbound siblings' outputs per the node's
//!    `StateReducer` (`Replace`/`SumNumbers`/`Collect`) into the aggregator's
//!    state key.
//! 5. `PassThrough` copies state through; `End` terminates the walk;
//!    `Predicate`/`Loop` get a minimal bounded handling (documented below).
//!
//! ## The prompt side-table
//!
//! The lowered `GraphConfig` carries only node ids + input mappers — the
//! authored prompts (and schema refs) are discarded by A1's lowering. The
//! runner therefore takes a [`WorkflowPlan`] (graph + per-node prompts +
//! schema table), which [`WorkflowPlan::parse`] / [`WorkflowPlan::from_workflow`]
//! build from the RON in a single pass alongside the existing lowering.
//!
//! ## Schema validation and pipelining
//!
//! - **Schema validation (A4):** `schema::validate(&result.text, schema)` runs
//!   at every agent-return site (bounded by `MAX_SCHEMA_RETRIES`); there is no
//!   stub placeholder.
//! - **No-barrier pipeline (A5):** linear chains that opt into item-level
//!   streaming dispatch through [`pipeline::run_pipeline`] rather than the
//!   per-stage PassThrough path.
