//! Anvil forge wiring — the REAL seams that make [`super::engine::run_climb`] a
//! live gated-forge (spec §6), plus [`drive_climb_full`] which assembles the
//! substrate (gate closure + probe, ledger, journal, lease) around them and
//! emits the [`ProtocolEvent::AnvilReceipt`] at the single climb exit (spec §8).
//!
//! - [`SandboxGate`] runs the pinned gate against a candidate's worktree through
//!   the sandbox (network-denied, minimized env), reusing the tested
//!   [`GateClosure::run_at`] exec path.
//! - [`SpawnBuilder`] forks a sub-agent with edit tools into a per-candidate git
//!   worktree. A1-minimal isolation: the builder runs SERIALLY and the process
//!   cwd is pointed at the candidate worktree for the fork (the spawner carries
//!   no per-fork cwd today); the per-workspace [`ClimbLease`] makes the serial
//!   assumption safe. Parallel-ensemble isolation is the documented follow-up.
//!
