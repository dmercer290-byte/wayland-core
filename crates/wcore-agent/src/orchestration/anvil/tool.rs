//! `Forge` — the session-level Anvil tool (A1.9): natural language in, a
//! machine-stamped receipt out.
//!
//! This is the smart-loop front door. The session model is the intent
//! detector: the tool description carries the routing law, so "make sure this
//! is right / iterate until it's green / it must be verified" reaches for
//! Forge the same way file edits reach for Edit — no new syntax for the user.
//!
//! Approval posture: the ONE human decision happens at this tool's boundary
//! (interactive sessions approve the Forge call like any Exec tool). Inside,
//! the climb runs in the trusted posture (spec §5) — forked builders have no
//! approval channel, and the gate machinery, not the model, decides success.

         touched. The winning change lands on a candidate branch for review.\n\
         - Runs the gate sandboxed (network-denied) every round; only a \
         passing gate earns the `verified` stamp. Returns a receipt: terminal \
         state, checks, iterations, cost.\n\
         - The gate comes from `[anvil] gate` config or is auto-detected \
         (cargo/npm/go/pytest/just/make).\n\
