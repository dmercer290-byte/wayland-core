//! Anvil — native gated-forge engine (sibling of [`crate::orchestration::council`]).
//! A1 skeleton slice.
//!
//! Anvil forges a candidate that passes a REAL executable gate, then stamps a
//! `verified` receipt. It rides the DRIVER rail: [`drive_climb`] is the entry
//! point, mirroring `council::drive_council` — NOT the test-only `GraphConfig`
//! scaffolding (spec §3, v2 correction).
//!
//! This slice establishes the module seam and the shared terminal-state
//! vocabulary. The climb loop (probe → ensemble → surgical → escalate), gate
//! closure pinning, ledger, and the `AnvilReceipt` protocol event land in the
//! subsequent A1 PRs. The whole engine honors the kill-switch
//! [`wcore_config::anvil::AnvilConfig::enabled`] (default `true`; the forge is
//! invocation-only and refuses without a real gate, so availability is safe).
//!
//! Spec: `docs/design/2026-07-12-anvil-native-gated-forge-design.md` (v2).
