//! Anvil climb engine — the loop that turns the A1.5 decision core + substrate
//! into a real forge (spec §6). `run_climb` seeds a candidate, runs the pinned
//! gate, climbs by surgical fail-set-accepted steps, and produces an honest
//! terminal state + receipt payload.
//!
//! The loop is written over two injected seams so it is unit-testable without a
//! live spawner or sandbox (the same discipline as the rest of anvil):
//! - [`Builder`] produces a candidate in an isolated worktree (real impl: a
//!   forked sub-agent with edit tools; test impl: a fake).
//! - [`GateExecutor`] runs the pinned gate against a candidate's worktree and
//!   returns the per-check [`GateReport`] (real impl: the sandbox + a gate-output
//!   parser; test impl: a fake).
//!
//! The real seams and the `/forge` wiring live in [`super::forge`]; this file is
//! the engine. It consumes every substrate piece: the gate closure + probe
//! ([`super::gates`]), the cost ledger ([`super::ledger`]), the acceptance +
//! order decision core ([`super::climb`]), the crash-recovery journal
//! ([`super::journal`]).
//!
//! Spec: `docs/design/2026-07-12-anvil-native-gated-forge-design.md` (v2) §6.
