//! Anvil climb lease — per-workspace mutual exclusion (spec §6.5).
//!
//! A climb mutates a real user workspace (candidate promotion, §6.5). Two climbs
//! on the same workspace — or a climb racing the user's own edits — must never
//! interleave. This lease is the guard: an atomically-created lock file under the
//! workspace whose presence means "a climb owns this workspace". Acquiring is a
//! single `O_EXCL` create (no check-then-create race); the holder's pid is
//! recorded so a crashed climb can reclaim ITS OWN orphaned lease on resume
//! (compare-and-swap [`steal_stale`](ClimbLease::steal_stale)) without a fragile
//! cross-platform liveness probe, and dropping the lease releases it — but only
//! if we still hold it, so a successor's lease is never clobbered.
//!
//! Detecting whether a *different* pid's lease is stale (its process died) is
//! left to the resume path (A1.6), which knows the pid it crashed as; this
//! module provides the safe primitive, not a liveness oracle.
//!
//! Spec: `docs/design/2026-07-12-anvil-native-gated-forge-design.md` (v2) §6.5.
