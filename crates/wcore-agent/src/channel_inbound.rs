//! `InboundSubscriber` — the inbound consumer for channel traffic.
//!
//! Structurally, the channel stack already had three of four parts wired:
//! the `Channel` adapters poll their platforms, the `ChannelManager` fans
//! every `ChannelEvent` onto a broadcast, and the pure dispatch kernel
//! (`wcore_channels::evaluate`) decides admit / observe / drop + routes a
//! session key. The fourth part — the consumer that actually *subscribes*
//! to that broadcast, runs the kernel, and drives an agent turn on admit —
//! was missing. This module is that consumer.
//!
//! The subscriber owns no engine logic itself: it drives turns through the
//! [`TurnDispatcher`] trait seam. The real engine-backed dispatcher is a
//! separate later increment; here we build the seam, the subscriber loop,
//! and tests against a mock dispatcher.
//!
//! ## Concurrency model
//!
//! Dispatch is `await`ed inline in the receive loop, so channel turns are
//! naturally SERIALIZED — one turn runs to completion (and its reply is
//! sent) before the next inbound event is processed. This is intentional:
//! it matches the single-engine constraint of the future real dispatcher
//! and keeps per-conversation ordering deterministic. The cost is that a
//! slow turn back-pressures the broadcast (which is bounded), so a long
//! turn can cause `Lagged` for very bursty channels — that is logged and
//! tolerated, not fatal.
//!
//! ## Subscribe-before-start ordering
//!
//! tokio's broadcast drops events emitted before a receiver exists. The
//! subscriber acquires its receiver in [`InboundSubscriber::spawn`], so
//! callers should `spawn` the subscriber BEFORE (or around) the
//! `ChannelManager::start_all` call — otherwise early inbound events
//! emitted between `start_all` and `spawn` are lost.
