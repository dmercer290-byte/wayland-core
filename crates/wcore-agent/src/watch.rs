//! W8b D.2 — `FileWatcher`: filesystem watcher for external-edit
//! detection, with an originated-by-self filter so engine writes
//! don't loop back into the agent's context.
//!
//! Built on `notify` (recommended platform-native watcher: inotify on
//! Linux, FSEvents on macOS, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows). Internal
//! callbacks publish events to a tokio `mpsc::Receiver`; the consumer
//! (orchestration loop) polls `next_external_event()` at turn boundaries.
//!
//! Self-origination: `Write` and `Edit` tools (D.4) call
//! `mark_self_originated(path)` immediately before writing. Any event
//! for the same path within `SELF_WRITE_WINDOW` after the mark is dropped on
//! the floor. The TTL prevents an engine write from masking a later
//! genuine external write.
//!
//! Wave RA — RELIABILITY MAJOR. The producer channel is **bounded** at
//! [`EVENT_CHANNEL_CAPACITY`]. `notify` callbacks run on a platform
//! thread (not a Tokio task) and must not block, so the inner publish
//! uses [`mpsc::Sender::try_send`] with drop-on-full semantics. File
//! events under heavy churn (build artifacts landing, large directory
//! syncs, IDE save-storms) can no longer drive engine memory growth.
//! A dropped event is recoverable — the consumer can rescan if needed —
//! while an OOM is not.
