//! v0.6.5 Task 3.2 — `SubprocessPluginRunner`.
//!
//! Spawns a native plugin binary, talks to it over JSON-Lines on stdin/stdout
//! ([`crate::rpc`]), and exposes a channel-based async API to the engine.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. [`SubprocessPluginRunner::load`] spawns the binary from
//!    `manifest.runtime.subprocess.binary_path` (resolved against the
//!    plugin directory containing `plugin.toml`).
//! 2. Sends [`SubprocessVerb::Init`] → expects
//!    [`SubprocessResponseBody::InitResult`].
//! 3. Sends [`SubprocessVerb::ListTools`] → expects
//!    [`SubprocessResponseBody::ToolsList`]; the resulting
//!    [`LoadedSubprocessPlugin`] carries the tool list for the host
//!    apply-pipeline.
//! 4. While the runner lives, the engine calls
//!    [`SubprocessPluginRunner::call_tool`] for each tool invocation.
//! 5. [`SubprocessPluginRunner::shutdown`] sends
//!    [`SubprocessVerb::Shutdown`], awaits [`SubprocessResponseBody::Ack`],
//!    then waits up to 5s for the OS process to exit before SIGKILL.
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! **Subprocess plugins inherit the engine's process privileges by default**
//! (cross-audit finding A7 / Q5). They are NOT a sandbox boundary — the OS
//! process has the same uid, env vars, file-system access, and network
//! reach as the host. The [`PluginAccessGate`] passed at load time still
//! gates host-callback invocations (memory, MCP, etc.), but anything the
//! plugin chooses to do *on its own* (raw syscalls, outbound HTTP, file
//! writes via its own `std::fs`) is fully privileged.
//!
//! Operators who want true isolation should run the engine itself inside a
//! container/sandbox. Plugin-level cgroups / namespaces are out of scope
//! for v0.6.5 and tracked as v0.7.x work.
//!
//! ## v0.6.5 Task 3.3 — Crash budget + restart policy
//!
//! Each [`LoadedSubprocessPlugin`] carries an `Arc<AtomicU8>` consecutive-
//! failure counter (mirroring the [`wcore_agent::plugins::PluginRunner`]
//! pattern from v0.6.5 Task 1.2). The following subprocess-level events
//! count as **one strike**:
//!
//! - Non-zero subprocess exit (or any broken-pipe / EOF on stdio).
//! - JSON-RPC parse error from the subprocess (malformed envelope).
//! - Tool-call timeout (`DEFAULT_RPC_TIMEOUT`, currently 30s).
//! - Subprocess-side protocol error reply (`SubprocessResponseBody::Error`).
//!
//! On strike, [`SubprocessPluginRunner::call_tool`] consults the counter:
//!
//! - If `counter < CRASH_THRESHOLD` (3), the runner restarts the subprocess
//!   in-place — backoff `100ms → 500ms → 2s` (one per strike), respawns the
//!   binary via the stored [`TransportFactory`], replays the Init + ListTools
//!   handshake, and **retries the failed call once** on the fresh instance.
//! - If `counter >= CRASH_THRESHOLD`, the call returns
//!   [`SubprocessPluginError::PermissionDenied`] with
//!   `"auto-disabled after 3 crashes"` and **does not respawn**.
//!
//! A successful `call_tool` resets the counter (consecutive-only semantics —
//! matches Task 1.2).
//!
//! ### State preservation across restart
//!
//! The engine-side registered tool set survives restart: the host apply
//! pipeline registered `LoadedSubprocessPlugin::tools` once at load time;
//! the runner restart only swaps the underlying transport + child handle,
//! and the engine continues routing `call_tool` requests to the same
//! `SubprocessPluginRunner` handle. The list of tools is **not** re-validated
//! across restart (we trust the plugin to honor its declared schema); a
//! divergent post-restart `ToolsList` is logged at `warn!` but does not
//! fail the restart. Schema-pin validation is a v0.6.7 follow-up.
//!
//! ### Engine-level crash counter integration
//!
//! For v0.6.5, crash tracking lives **inside** the `SubprocessPluginRunner`
//! (per-plugin `Arc<AtomicU8>`). The engine-level counter on
//! [`wcore_agent::plugins::PluginRunner`] from Task 1.2 is NOT wired into
//! this — the wiring lives in the engine adapter (Task 2.7's territory) and
//! lands as a v0.6.7 follow-up. Telemetry callers can read the current
//! count via [`SubprocessPluginRunner::crash_count`].
//!
//! ## Testing
//!
//! Real subprocess spawn is exercised in `tests/subprocess_e2e.rs` via
//! [`SubprocessPluginRunner::load_with_transport`] driven by a
//! `tokio::io::duplex()` pair — avoiding a real binary keeps CI fast and
//! cross-platform-safe. Wave 4 (Task 4.5) ships a real example plugin
//! that exercises actual process spawning end-to-end.
