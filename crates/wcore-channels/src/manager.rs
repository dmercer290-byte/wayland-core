//! `ChannelManager` — drives a registry of `Channel` impls.
//!
//! v0.7.0 2.A.2: each channel runs on its own tokio task that
//! polls `poll_events()` and forwards results to a single broadcast
//! channel the engine + UI subscribe to. Outbound sends go through
//! `send_to(name, msg)` which routes to the channel's send_message.
//!
//! Concurrency model: each channel is held in an `Arc<Mutex<Box<dyn
//! Channel>>>` so the poll task and the send path serialize against
//! the same instance (most platform SDKs aren't `Sync`-on-write).
//! Polling cadence is configurable; default 250ms.
