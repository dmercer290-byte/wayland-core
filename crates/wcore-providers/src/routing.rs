//! Per-message-shape smart model routing.
//!
//! # Status: WIRED (v0.6.3 D.1 Round 1 cleanup)
//!
//! All types + the [`select_tier`] / [`route`] functions compile and test.
//! v0.6.3 closes the producer/consumer gap: `wcore-agent`'s engine builds a
//! [`RequestShape`] each turn, calls [`route`], and stamps the resulting
//! label onto `LlmRequest::routing_hint` via [`RoutingDecision::to_hint`];
//! [`crate::ProviderChain::stream`] reads that hint and surfaces it in a
//! `tracing` span for dispatch observability.
//!
//! Note: the engine-side producer populates `input_tokens`,
//! `max_output_tokens`, `tool_call_count`, and `requires_vision` from real
//! request data; `code_ratio` is left at a conservative `0.0` (a real
//! code-ratio scanner is out of scope), so this producer never emits the
//! `code_heavy`/`Balanced` decision — the vision/large-context/tool-heavy/
//! simple decisions are all genuine.
//!
//! Given a [`RequestShape`] (token count, code-heaviness, tool-use prevalence,
//! vision requirement), [`select_tier`] picks one of three tiers
//! ([`RoutingTier::Cheap`], [`RoutingTier::Balanced`], [`RoutingTier::Premium`]).
//!
//! The higher-level [`route`] returns a [`RoutingDecision`] that names the rule
//! that fired, so the picker's behavior is visible in trace observability.
//!
//! Ported from the prior Genesis Python engine's smart model routing. The Python
//! version routed by parsing the raw user message; this Rust port lifts the
//! decision to a typed request shape so callers — provider chain, agent
//! engine — can supply structured inputs (token counts, vision flag) instead
//! of doing keyword matching at this layer.
