//! `wcore-swarm` — productized worktree-isolated multi-agent dispatch.
//!
//! Foundation for M5.6 (consensus) + M5.7 (memory propagation). The
//! public surface below is SPEC-LOCKED — downstream M5.6/M5.7 dispatch
//! briefs match against these exact signatures. Do not extend without
//! updating the roadmap.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! use wcore_swarm::{Swarm, SwarmBrief};
//!
//! # async fn demo() -> wcore_swarm::Result<()> {
//! let swarm = Swarm::new(std::path::Path::new("/path/to/repo"))?;
//! let brief = SwarmBrief {
//!     task: "implement W7 fixture builder".into(),
//!     base_branch: "main".into(),
//!     worker_branch_prefix: "swarm/w7".into(),
//!     worker_command: vec!["bash".into(), "-c".into(), "echo hi".into()],
//!     timeout: Duration::from_secs(3600),
//!     env: vec![],
//! };
//! let handles = swarm.dispatch(brief, 4).await?;
//! let results = swarm.collect(handles).await?;
//! swarm.cleanup().await?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! # Lifecycle invariants
//!
//! - `dispatch` REFUSES if the base repo is dirty (collision detection).
//! - Each worker gets a fresh worktree at `<repo>/.swarm-worktrees/<id>`.
//! - `collect` waits for all workers (already-finished handles in the
//!   v0.6 implementation; future versions may aggregate streaming output).
//! - `cleanup` removes ALL worker worktrees. Idempotent.
//! - Workers run as subprocesses of the orchestrator (process boundary;
//!   no shared memory). All git ops use argv mode (no shell interp).
//!
//! # What's NOT in v0.6
//!
//! - Cross-host dispatch.
//! - Encrypted channels (workers trust the orchestrator's UID).
//! - Live stdout streaming. Final stdout/stderr are returned by `collect`.
//!   For hung-worker detection, workers may opt into a minimal heartbeat
//!   via [`heartbeat::HeartbeatWriter`]; the orchestrator polls it via
//!   [`Swarm::worker_status`].
