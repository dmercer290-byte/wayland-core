//! User-selectable reducer modes over a collected `Vec<SwarmResult>`.
//!
//! The subprocess swarm ([`crate::Swarm::dispatch`] + [`crate::Swarm::collect`])
//! produces a flat `Vec<SwarmResult>`. Callers (the `genesis swarm` CLI, the
//! orchestrator) historically printed those raw. This module adds a single
//! selector — [`ReduceMode`] — that routes the same `Vec<SwarmResult>` through
//! one of four reducers:
//!
//! - [`ReduceMode::Mesh`]     — flat passthrough (the historical behaviour).
//! - [`ReduceMode::Fleet`]    — a success/failure roll-up summary.
//! - [`ReduceMode::Consensus`] — [`Consensus::majority`] over the results.
//! - [`ReduceMode::Debate`]   — [`Debate::evaluate`] treating the collected
//!   batch as a single round.
//!
//! Consensus/Debate need a [`Scorer`]; [`reduce`] uses the supplied one (the
//! CLI defaults to [`RuleBasedScorer::normalized_stdout`]). Mesh/Fleet ignore
//! the scorer.
