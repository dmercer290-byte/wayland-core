//! #162 — regression guard for per-assistant MCP scoping on the DEFERRED
//! (wayland#551) config-MCP connect path.
//!
//! #111 added `only_for_assistant` scoping for config MCP servers. The filter
//! (`McpConfig::servers_for_assistant`) is applied at TWO injection choke
//! points: `AgentBootstrap::build()` and the wayland#551 deferred background
//! connect inside `run_json_stream_mode`. The bootstrap choke point is pinned
//! by `crates/wcore-agent/tests/bootstrap_test.rs`; the deferred path had NO
//! test. If the one-line filter on the deferred path
//! (`config.mcp.servers_for_assistant(assistant.as_deref())`, main.rs) were
//! reverted in a refactor, a scoped server would leak to every assistant and
//! nothing in the suite would notice. This test closes that gap.
//!
//! ## How "was the server dialed?" is observed
//!
//! The deferred path background-connects the scoped servers and then emits one
//! `mcp_ready`/`mcp_failed` json-stream event PER SERVER it attempted (see
//! `integrate_deferred_mcp` / `mcp_failed_events_for`). `McpManager::connect_all`
//! records per-server health and always returns `Ok`, so a server pointed at a
//! non-existent command settles as `Failed` and still emits a
//! `{"type":"mcp_failed","name":...}` event naming it. That event's PRESENCE is
//! therefore a reliable, fully cross-platform proof that the server was in the
//! scoped set and a connect was attempted — no real MCP handshake needed.
//!
//! The config declares two stdio servers, both pointed at a bogus command:
//!   * `open_diag` — UNSCOPED (global). It is dialed for every assistant, so
//!     seeing its event is a synchronization barrier proving the deferred phase
//!     actually ran (guards against a false negative where the phase never
//!     executed and the scoped server "isn't dialed" for the wrong reason).
//!   * `diag` — scoped `only_for_assistant = ["concierge"]`. It must be dialed
//!     ONLY for `--assistant concierge`, and never for a non-matching or absent
//!     assistant (fail-closed).
//!
//! ## Hermetic by construction
//!
//! Mirrors `acp_gate_d012.rs`: every child points `GENESIS_HOME` + `HOME` at a
//! throwaway tempdir and strips the full provider-credential env set. No LLM
//! turn is driven (no message frame is sent) — the deferred connect settles in
//! the pre-message phase — so no provider is ever contacted.
