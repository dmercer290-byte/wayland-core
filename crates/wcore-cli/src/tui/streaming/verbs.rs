//! The streaming verb pool + single-pick mechanics (v0.9.2 W6, SPEC §4).
//!
//! The streaming-status widget shows a playful gerund verb while a turn is
//! in flight ("✻ Stoking the forge… (12s · ↑ 88 tokens · drafting reply)").
//! Unlike v0.9.1's time-based rotation, the verb is **sampled once per turn**
//! and held for the whole turn — the `useState(|| sample(pool))` pattern.
//! [`pick_turn_verb`] is the pure sampler; the per-turn seed lives on
//! `SessionView::turn_verb_seed` (set once at `StreamStart` by the protocol
//! bridge), so every frame in a turn renders the same verb and consecutive
//! turns land on different verbs.
//!
//! ## Pool provenance (SPEC §4 sourcing recipe)
//!
//! The pool is Genesis's own voice — gerund-verbs (Claude Code's *grammar*)
//! with Forge's *playfulness* and Hearth/forge brand flavor. It is built from
//! three sources, none copied verbatim:
//!
//! 1. **Forge-tone rewrites** — Forge's 130 witty phrases
//!    (`wittyPhrases.ts`, Apache-2.0 / Google-LLC, *tone reference only*) are
//!    mostly meme/pop-culture lines, not gerunds. Their *playfulness* is mined
//!    and re-expressed as Genesis gerunds (e.g. Forge's "Brewing fresh bytes"
//!    → our "Brewing fresh bytes" is paraphrased to "Steeping the bytes").
//! 2. **CC rewrites** — Claude Code's ~190 gerund-verbs are fully reworded so
//!    NONE are direct copies. A blocklist test (`pool_has_zero_cc_verbs`)
//!    asserts the ~20 most distinctive CC verbs never ship.
//! 3. **Genesis/Hearth/forge originals** — brand-flavored gerunds like
//!    "Stoking the forge", "Tempering the steel", "Banking the coals".
//!
//! The pool is `&'static [&'static str]` — zero allocation, embedded in the
//! binary. Acceptance: ≥150 entries, zero duplicates, zero CC-verbatim copies.

/// The streaming verb pool. Each entry is a gerund phrase in Genesis's voice:
/// forge/hearth craft imagery, light playfulness, and earnest "working on it"
/// phrasing. ≥150 entries, all unique, none copied verbatim from Claude Code
/// or Forge (see module docs for provenance).
///
/// Display appends an ellipsis ("…") at the render site, so entries here carry
/// NO trailing punctuation.
