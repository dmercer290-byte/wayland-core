//! Diagnostics surfaces — `/doctor`, `/cost`, and `/memory`.
//!
//! Three compact diagnostic screens implemented as one [`Surface`] with a
//! mode switch:
//!
//! - **Doctor** — system dependency + environment health. Runs the real
//!   [`crate::doctor::collect`] probe on `on_enter` and the `r` re-run
//!   key; the same data that `wayland-core --doctor` prints.
//! - **Cost** — session token usage and spend, read live from
//!   [`App::cost`] (populated by the protocol bridge from
//!   [`ProtocolEvent::SessionCost`] events).
//!   ([`wcore_protocol::events::ProtocolEvent::SessionCost`])
//! - **Memory** — what long-term memory holds, scanned from the project
//!   memory directory via `wcore_memory::store`, with a real delete.
//!
//! ## Live wiring (Wave 3)
//!
//! - **Doctor** — `on_enter` and the `r` key call [`crate::doctor::collect`]
//!   on a short-lived worker thread (the probe is async; the surface
//!   hooks are sync), then convert its [`crate::doctor::CheckResult`] rows
//!   into [`HealthCheck`] rows.
//! - **Cost** — `render` reads [`App::cost`] every frame, so cost events
//!   that stream in while the screen is open are reflected immediately.
//! - **Memory** — `on_enter` scans `auto_memory_dir(cwd)` with
//!   `scan_memory_files`; the `d` key deletes the selected entry with
//!   `delete_memory` and re-scans.
//!
//! The OSC-9 desktop-notification helper ([`osc9_notification`]) and the
//! terminal-bell helper ([`terminal_bell`]) are pure string functions so
//! they are unit-testable without a terminal.
