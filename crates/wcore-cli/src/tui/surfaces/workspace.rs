//! Workspace surface (surfaces 02 + 03) — the 3-pane conversation
//! workspace, idle and agent-live.
//!
//! The workspace is the screen users look at all day: a transcript of
//! user/assistant/system turns plus the in-flight stream and tool-call
//! cards, a right rail (path map, tools panel, activity feed), and a
//! composer at the bottom. It implements the FROZEN `Surface` trait —
//! local UI state (`composer`, `approval_sel`) lives on `WorkspaceSurface`;
//! all shared/conversation state is read from `&App`.
//!
//! Layout follows `mockup.html` surfaces 02 (idle) and 03 (agent-live):
//! a `transcript | rail` body and the composer below. The chrome
//! redesign removed the workspace's own near-top status line — the one
//! bottom status bar the router renders carries all live stats now, so
//! the workspace owns only the transcript, rail, and composer. The
//! Hearth Palette is applied via `Theme`; flat color only.
