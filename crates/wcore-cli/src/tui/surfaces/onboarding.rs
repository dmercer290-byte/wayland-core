//! Onboarding surface (surface 01) — the first-run connect/configure flow.
//!
//! A five-step flow: **Connect → Validating → AddMore → Name → Ready**.
//!
//! Auth is **API-key only**. There is deliberately NO OAuth path anywhere
//! in this surface — no row, no key, no "sign in with…" affordance (a
//! non-working choice is the worst kind of friction).
//!
//! The three real paths the Connect step offers, in display order:
//!  1. Paste an API key — the provider is detected from the key prefix.
//!     The recognizer checks the **most-specific prefix first** so an
//!     OpenRouter `sk-or-v1-…` key is never mistaken for OpenAI's bare
//!     `sk-`. A genuinely ambiguous bare `sk-` key (OpenAI / DeepSeek /
//!     Moonshot all share it) — or an unrecognized one — opens a provider
//!     picker rather than guessing. The key is then **validated with a
//!     live API call** against *the detected provider's* endpoint; only a
//!     key that provider accepts advances the flow. After a key validates
//!     the user may add another provider or continue, and is finally
//!     asked for a display name.
//!  2. Use Ollama — a local provider, no key, no name prompt. The local
//!     server is probed for reachability before the flow claims a
//!     connection, and the provider selection is persisted so the next
//!     launch does not re-onboard.
//!  3. Skip for now — defer provider setup. The config layer carries a
//!     `[default] read_only` posture for this path (see
//!     `wcore_config::DefaultConfig::read_only`), but the writer wiring that
//!     persists it from onboarding and the engine gate that refuses outbound
//!     calls when it is set are wired separately. Until both land, onboarding
//!     deliberately does NOT promise "no API calls" as an enforced guarantee
//!     here — it is framed as deferred setup only.
//!
//! On entry the surface scans `std::env` for the common provider API-key
//! variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, …). If any are
//! set it announces them on the Connect step and offers to connect them
//! directly — each still runs through the same live validation.
//!
//! Config persistence: completing the API-key flow writes every gathered
//! provider + the display name into the global `config.toml` via
//! [`crate::tui::engine_bridge::write_onboarding_config`]. Completion then
//! switches straight to the Workspace surface — onboarding does **not**
//! emit any slash command (an earlier version emitted `/setup`, which is
//! not a registered command and surfaced as "Unknown command: /setup").
//!
//! Validation runs off the render loop: a `spawn_blocking` task performs
//! the bounded HTTP request and reports back over an `mpsc` channel that
//! [`OnboardingSurface::render`] drains each frame. The UI never blocks.
