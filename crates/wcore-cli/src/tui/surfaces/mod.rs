//! Surface trait, surface identity/actions, and the surface router.
//!
//! A "surface" is one full-screen view of the TUI (the workspace, the
//! config screen, etc.). The `Surface` trait, `SurfaceId`, and
//! `SurfaceAction` are FROZEN Wave-0 contracts — Wave-1 agents implement
//! `Surface` for each concrete screen and must not change these
//! signatures. The `Router` owns the active + overlay surface, dispatches
//! input/render, and applies the `SurfaceAction`s surfaces return.
