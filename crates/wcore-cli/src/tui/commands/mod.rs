//! Slash-command system: the command registry, dispatch, and the
//! `@`-reference module.
//!
//! T1.8 — the [`CommandRegistry`] is the single source of truth for the
//! TUI's slash commands. It feeds three consumers: the command palette
//! (T1.4), the `/help` grouped listing, and the slash dispatcher's
//! "did you mean" suggestion. T1.9 fills the `at_refs` module below; this
//! file must keep the `mod at_refs;` declaration so the two agents build
//! in parallel without colliding.
//!
//! ## Model
//!
//! A [`Command`] carries a name, an [`IntentGroup`], a one-line
//! consequence-framed description, and a `destructive` flag. The ~14
//! grounded commands come straight from `ux-krug-sutherland.md` §3a,
//! sorted into the six intent groups. The registry is *mutable* — user-
//! invocable skills extend it at runtime via [`CommandRegistry::register`]
//! (wiring skills in is a later wave; the API is here so it can).
//!
//! The slash [`dispatch`](CommandRegistry::dispatch) parses a slash line
//! and returns a [`Dispatch`]: an exact match, a "did you mean" with the
//! closest command (Damerau-Levenshtein distance ≤ 2), `/help` rendered
//! as a grouped listing, or "unknown" when nothing is close enough.

// `pub` so the workspace composer's `@`-reference autocomplete (Wave 2)
// can call `at_refs::complete` and render `at_refs::Completion`.
//
// `at_refs` is a thin facade over four focused submodules — W3-B split the
// engine apart once the single file passed the AGENTS.md 1000-line
// guideline. The submodules are crate-private; everything the composer
// needs is re-exported through `at_refs`, so `at_refs::*` paths are
// unchanged for every existing caller.
