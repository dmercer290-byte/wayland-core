//! Central view-state model for the ratatui TUI.
//!
//! `App` is the single source of truth the TUI renders from. It is mutated
//! ONLY by two writers — the protocol bridge (T0.5, draining engine events)
//! and the surface router (T0.3, applying `SurfaceAction`s). Surfaces read
//! `&App` to render and receive `&mut App` in `handle_key`; they never spawn
//! their own writers.
//!
//! All public types in this file are FROZEN Wave-0 contracts: Wave-1 surface
//! agents build against these signatures and must not change them. Fields are
//! deliberately minimal-but-real — grounded in the mockup surfaces and the
//! `ProtocolEvent` payloads — so later waves extend by adding, not reshaping.
