//! Shared widget library — every widget is a free function.
//!
//! FROZEN Wave-0 contract: the function signatures re-exported here are
//! the integration boundary the surfaces paint with.
//!
//! Convention: every drawing widget takes `(frame, area, &model, &theme)`
//! and renders into `area`; it never returns or mutates state.

// The widget free fns are re-exported here as the flat `widgets::` API
// surface, but no caller exists until the Wave-1 surface agents wire them
// up — so the `pub use` lines below read as unused re-exports. The allow
// is scoped to this module and is the deliberate cost of publishing the
// frozen widget contract ahead of its consumers; it stops mattering the
// moment a surface calls `widgets::status_bar` etc. (`unused_imports` is
// a distinct lint from the `dead_code` allow in `tui/mod.rs`, so the
// re-exports need their own allow until Wave 1 wires them up.)
