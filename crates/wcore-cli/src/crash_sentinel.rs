//! T1-E2: Dirty-death flag for crash detection.
//!
//! Writes a file at `$GENESIS_HOME/.dirty-death.<pid>` on startup and removes
//! it on clean shutdown via `Drop`. If a flag whose owning process is no
//! longer alive is present at next startup, that run crashed or was killed
//! without unwinding — surface a warning so observability/telemetry can
//! correlate. During a panic the `Drop` guard intentionally leaves the flag
//! behind so the next run detects the unclean exit.
//!
//! #181: the flag is scoped PER PROCESS. The original single un-scoped
//! `.dirty-death` was shared by every concurrent engine (chat + teammates +
//! subagents + doctor), so any sibling exiting uncleanly made every other
//! launch report "previous run did not shut down cleanly". Startup now scans
//! for `.dirty-death.<pid>` files, reports only those whose pid is dead,
//! reaps them after reporting, and migrates (report + delete) the legacy
//! un-scoped file once.
//!
//! #181 audit hardening: the flag file records its owner's OS process START
//! TIME. At scan, a pid-alive flag whose recorded start time matches the OS
//! start time is verified-live and never touched; a mismatch means the pid
//! was recycled and the original owner died dirty (report + reap). When a
//! start time cannot be determined the scan is conservative: the flag is
//! never treated as a crash and is only reaped silently once older than 30
//! days. Deleting a flag is the CLAIM on reporting it — concurrent starters
//! race on the delete, so one incident warns exactly once (TOCTOU fix).
//!
//! Source pattern: Forge Apache-2.0 `SessionCheckpointService.ts` (dirty-death
//! flag write-on-start / clear-on-clean-exit). The Forge version also persists
//! a checkpoint payload + history; we lift only the flag mechanic here. The
//! richer checkpoint payload is out of scope for T1-E2.
