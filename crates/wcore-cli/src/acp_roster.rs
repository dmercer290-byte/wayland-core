//! `CliAgentRoster` — the CLI-layer [`AgentRoster`] implementation (persona
//! PR-3').
//!
//! `wcore-acp` owns the transport-neutral [`AgentRoster`] seam but must not
//! depend on the identity sources; the CLI owns enumeration. This is that
//! implementation, mirroring how `EngineTurnEngine`/`EngineA2aHandler` are
//! injected from here.
//!
//! # What is enumerated — and what is deliberately NOT
//!
//! TRUSTED sources only:
//!   * **`AgentPack`** — compiled-in personas. Trusted by construction (they
//!     ship in the binary).
//!   * **Global agent YAML** — `genesis_config_dir()/agents/*.yaml`, i.e. the
//!     operator's own `~/.genesis-core/agents`. Operator-authored ⇒ trusted.
//!
//! NEVER enumerated:
//!   * **Project-supplied manifests** (`<project>/.genesis-core/agents/*.yaml`,
//!     `AgentSource::ProjectYaml`). This is UNTRUSTED repo content. Enumerating
//!     it would let a hostile checkout publish a selectable persona whose
//!     `system_prompt` it controls, injecting attacker text into the permanent
//!     system prefix of any ACP session that selected it — the same forged-trust
//!     class the `@include`/project-`system_prompt` clamps close. We exclude it
//!     STRUCTURALLY: the roster only ever reads the ONE global agents dir, so a
//!     project dir is never consulted. See `project_agents_are_never_enumerated`.
//!   * **Isolated profiles** (`wcore-config`'s profile dirs). A profile is a
//!     CREDENTIAL boundary (its own `GENESIS_HOME` ⇒ own keys/.env/memory).
//!     Surfacing profiles as in-process selectable agents would mean serving
//!     several credential identities from one process — the multi-profile
//!     credential-bleed the red-team rejected. Per-profile isolation is the
//!     supervisor/router topology (one process PER profile), not this roster.
//!
//! # Security invariants
//!   * **R4 (no secrets)** — [`AgentManifest`] carries `system_prompt`, `model`,
//!     `allowed_tools`, `max_turns`. [`AgentInfo`] carries ONLY `id` + `label` +
//!     optional `description`. [`CliAgentRoster::to_info`] is the one mapping and
//!     it DROPS every capability/prompt field. Enforced by
//!     `agent_info_never_carries_prompt_or_model`.
//!   * **R3 (authz-gated)** — [`AgentRoster::list`] returns only what the calling
//!     principal may select. The ACP server today authenticates ONE principal (the
//!     trusted local operator holding `acp-server-key`), so the authorized set is
//!     exactly the trusted-local set enumerated here. When per-principal authz
//!     lands, filter HERE — every caller (including the `session/create` selector
//!     check, which routes through `contains`) inherits the gate for free.
//!   * **Feature default-OFF** — nothing installs this roster unless the operator
//!     passes `--enable-agent-selection` to `acp serve`. With no roster installed
//!     the server returns an empty catalog and `AgentNotFound` for any selector.
