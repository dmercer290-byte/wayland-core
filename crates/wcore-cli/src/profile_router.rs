//! `CliProfileRouter` — the wcore-cli implementation of
//! [`wcore_acp::router::ProfileRouter`] (persona-profiles PR-7).
//!
//! An in-process persona overlay (PR-4') and a `profile:<name>` agent are two
//! DIFFERENT mechanisms. A persona shares this process's single credential/home
//! identity; a profile is a SEPARATE PROCESS (`wcore acp serve --profile
//! <name>`) with its OWN `GENESIS_HOME` ⇒ own keys/.env/memory/SOUL. One
//! profile per process is the ONLY safe topology — N profiles in one address
//! space is the credential-bleed the red-team rejected (shared
//! `GENESIS_HOME`/`*_API_KEY`/egress singletons). This router therefore never
//! resolves a profile to an in-process overlay; it spawns/routes to that
//! profile's dedicated child and forwards JSON-RPC over a localhost loopback.
//!
//! # Invariants carried from the design (06-supervisor-seams) + review hardening
//!   * **One child = one profile = one identity.** Never multiplex profiles.
//!   * **No inherited credentials.** A child is spawned with a CLEARED
//!     environment (only a credential-free allowlist is passed through), so its
//!     `*_API_KEY`/`.env` identity comes SOLELY from its own `GENESIS_HOME` — a
//!     `*_API_KEY` present in the supervisor's own env can't shadow it.
//!   * **Fail closed.** An invalid/absent profile ([`profile_dir`] error or a
//!     missing home dir) returns [`AcpError::Agent`] (⇒ `AgentNotFound`) — the
//!     child is NEVER spawned and we NEVER fall through to the default home.
//!   * **No half-up children.** A spawned child that fails its health-check is
//!     killed + reaped before the error returns.
//!   * **Per-child key.** Each child gets a fresh random `X-API-Key` injected
//!     via `GENESIS_ACP_SERVER_KEY`; one operator key is never shared.
//!   * **Signal-safe reaping.** Live children are held in a process-global
//!     registry so the signal handler (which `std::process::exit`s, bypassing
//!     `Drop`) can reap every child — no orphaned credential-bearing processes.
//!   * **Bounded.** Concurrent children are capped.
