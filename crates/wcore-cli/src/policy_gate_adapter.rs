//! v0.6.4 Task 2.5: bridge `wcore_mcp::PolicyCheck` ↔ `wcore_agent::PolicyGate`.
//!
//! `wcore-mcp` lives below `wcore-agent` in the workspace dep graph, so it
//! cannot depend on the orchestration-layer [`PolicyGate`] directly without
//! introducing a cycle. The transport crate solves this by exposing a
//! minimal [`PolicyCheck`] trait; this adapter — living one layer up in
//! `wcore-cli`, the only crate that already sees both — wraps a
//! `PolicyGate` and implements the trait.
//!
//! ## Why `Resource::Tool`, not `Resource::McpServer`
//!
//! v0.6.4 Task 2.5 gates **the tool name** the MCP client is asking us to
//! invoke, exactly mirroring the in-process gate in `wcore_agent::engine`.
//! Per-MCP-server gating (one `Resource::McpServer("name")` grant gating
//! the entire server) is a strictly coarser policy and can be layered at
//! the transport-acceptance boundary in a later task. Routing the tool
//! name through `PolicyGate::check_tool` keeps the in-process and
//! over-the-wire authorization stories identical, so a tool that the
//! engine denies internally is also denied over MCP.
//!
//! ## Backwards compatibility
//!
//! [`wcore_mcp::AllowAll`] stays in place for tests and standalone
//! scenarios. The `genesis-core mcp-serve` subcommand swaps it for a
//! `PolicyGateAdapter` so the over-the-wire surface respects the same ACL
//! as the in-process engine.
