# Changelog

## [0.12.23](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.22...v0.12.23) (2026-07-05)

A capabilities-and-honesty release. The engine now reasons in images across
every provider, extracts text from office documents, and is candid about what it
can and cannot do — while three fixes make failures loud, close a web-policy
bypass, and keep network access bounded to genuinely-local sessions.


### Highlights

* **Images as first-class content across all providers** (#648). A new
  `ContentBlock::Image` is encoded consistently for every OpenAI-compatible
  model, gated by a real `supports_vision` capability check so vision-blind
  models fail clearly instead of silently dropping the image.
* **`vision_analyze` accepts local image files** (#637), not just URLs — point it
  at a path on disk and it reads the bytes directly.
* **Office-document extraction** (#650, Phase 1). A new `doc_extract` tool pulls
  text out of office documents, with an explicit truncation contract so callers
  know when output was cut.
* **Honest capability availability** (#660). A boot-time advisory and
  channel-media notices tell you up front what the running configuration can
  actually do, instead of discovering a gap mid-task.


### Reliability

* **Consecutive tool failures are counted globally, not per-tool** (#160), so a
  model alternating between two failing tools still trips the runaway-loop cap.
* **Oversized tool outputs are shed before a context-overflow abort** (#636), and
  **silently-undersized context windows are corrected with a drift guard**
  (#165) so long sessions degrade gracefully instead of dying.
* **Conversation-heavy overflow degrades cleanly** at the second compaction rung
  (#646).
* **Per-assistant scoping for config MCP servers** (#111) keeps one assistant's
  MCP configuration from leaking into another's.


### Security & correctness

* **Website policy fails CLOSED** (#662). When a website-access policy cannot be
  evaluated (present but malformed config), access is denied rather than allowed
  — closing a bypass at the single chokepoint every caller funnels through.
* **`network=Inherit` is gated to genuinely-local sessions only** (#657). A
  channel- or Full-posture session no longer inherits ambient network access;
  only a session with no channel tool-posture stays local-inherit.
* **Tools fail loud instead of empty-success** (#661). Swallowed failures that
  previously returned an empty success now surface as real errors.
* **Silent operator and feature toggles are logged** (#664) across memory, tools,
  and browser, so state changes are auditable.

## [0.12.22](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.21...v0.12.22) (2026-07-04)

A reliability release focused on runaway-loop resilience and honest tool-error
signals. Agents that would previously burn a whole turn retrying a failing tool
now stop cleanly and let the host offer a "Continue"; MCP tool failures are
finally visible to the agent instead of masquerading as success; and two
hardening fixes close an out-of-memory vector and a duplicate-connection bug.


### Highlights

* **Retry-cap for stuck tool loops** (#475). A model that keeps calling a tool
  that keeps failing — e.g. an MCP call retried with a new wrong argument each
  time — no longer burns the turn's budget mid-thought. A per-run failure cap
  stops the run with clear guidance and, paired with the finish-reason work
  below, lets the host offer **Continue** to resume with fresh headroom. Tunable
  via `WAYLAND_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TOOL_FAILURES` (the shell tool is deliberately
  exempt so a normal build/test burst is never mistaken for a stuck loop).
* **MCP tool failures are now honest** (#475). Every MCP tool-level failure —
  argument-validation errors, API errors — used to look like *success* to the
  agent, the error badge, and the model's own error signal, because the MCP
  `isError` flag was dropped on the way in. It now propagates end-to-end, so
  failures are visible (and the retry-cap can see them). The error text still
  reaches the model so it can read it and recover.
* **"Out of turns" now offers Continue, not "use a bigger model"** (#457). When
  a run hits its per-turn cap, the engine emits a distinct `max_turns`
  finish-reason (mapped to the ACP `max_turn_requests` stop) so hosts render a
  resume affordance instead of a model-failure message.


### Hardening

* **Bounded the OpenAI chat-path tool-call accumulator** (#136). A runaway or
  hostile streaming response can no longer allocate unbounded tool-call slots;
  an out-of-range streamed index now fails the stream closed.
* **`/mcp add` is idempotent** (#135). Re-adding an already-connected MCP server
  no longer spawns a duplicate connection — or, for stdio servers, a duplicate
  child process.


### Tests & docs

* **WebFetch extraction-timeout coverage** (#110). The readability
  extraction-timeout → raw-body fallback is now tested with an injected slow
  extractor, and the orphaned-thread behavior is documented honestly.

## [0.12.21](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.20...v0.12.21) (2026-07-03)

A security and reliability release. It closes GHSA-8r7g end-to-end on the ACP
transport — the secret approval `resume_token` is now carried to the host and
required on the wire, so a model can no longer self-approve a bridge-backed gate
— and it fixes a Windows regression that had left users unable to run any
command at all.


### Security

* **acp:** carry + accept the secret `resume_token` end-to-end on the ACP transport (GHSA-8r7g M2) — the projection now surfaces the server-minted `apr-` secret to the host, and the `/resolve` endpoint routes it to the approval bridge (secret-preferred, falling back to the manager's `call_id` path). Bridge-backed gates (Crucible council / egress consent) raised during an ACP turn are now resolvable instead of hanging to their TTL, and the model-self-approval class is closed for them ([#152](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/152)) ([ce63ca6](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/ce63ca64))
* **acp:** stamp the bridge secret `resume_token` on the ACP relay (GHSA-8r7g M1) — bridge-backed gate frames on the ACP relay now carry the secret token at parity with the stdin/TUI transports ([#147](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/147)) ([98c387b](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/98c387b4))


### Bug Fixes

* **sandbox:** drain the Windows AppContainer stdout/stderr pipes concurrently with the child — a P1 that had left Windows users unable to run **any** command: output past the ~4 KB pipe buffer blocked the child, which timed the wait out and returned blank or truncated results. Reader threads now drain both pipes while the child runs; live-verified on the Windows CI leg ([#151](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/151)) ([1619632](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/1619632d))
* **sandbox:** skip missing bwrap bind sources instead of fail-spawning — a manifest-declared mount whose source is absent on a fresh HOME no longer aborts the sandbox spawn (`--bind-try` / `--ro-bind-try`); fixes a model-agnostic empty-bash hang ([#148](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/148)) ([d434dd5](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/d434dd51))
* **cli:** a mid-turn Stop must not strand the json-stream session — Stop now cancels the in-flight turn but keeps the session alive; only EOF and `/exit` end it, restoring the json-stream protocol §2.2 contract ([#150](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/150)) ([d2dd423](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/d2dd4238))
* **cli:** honor the config `[default] approval_mode` in json-stream mode — json-stream sessions now apply the configured approval posture, not only `--force` ([#149](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/149)) ([b042e32](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/b042e32e))
* **cli:** emit the json-stream `ready` frame before config MCP servers connect — the host sees `ready` immediately; configured MCP servers integrate in the background and settle at the next command boundary ([#146](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/146)) ([56953b6](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/56953b6e))


### Features

* **channels:** per-conversation autonomous-send rate cap — a runaway ping-pong backstop that caps autonomous auto-replies per conversation (default 30 / 10 min) so two agents wired to the same channel can't loop forever burning cost and quota. Human and operator sends bypass it entirely ([#154](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/154)) ([876f4e5](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/876f4e52))

## [0.12.20](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.19...v0.12.20) (2026-07-02)


### Features

* **agent:** host-delegated send_message hook (host-send-transport) with a hard approval gate — `WAYLAND_SEND_MESSAGE_HOST_DELEGATE=1` routes sends through a call_id-correlated json-stream round-trip; approval always fronts the request (Exec category, never auto-approved, Always-scope downgrades to Once) ([#141](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/141)) ([#144](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/144)) ([5bb5899](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/5bb5899e))


### Bug Fixes

* **agent:** honor omitted `--max-tokens` with per-model output sizing — known models size to their real ceiling; unknown models on omit-safe providers (gemini/openrouter/flux) omit the wire field so the provider's natural ceiling applies; anthropic/generic keep the sized floor; explicit caps and per-spawn sub-agent caps always bind ([#112](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/112)) ([#138](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/138)) ([3ecbc2c](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/3ecbc2c4))
* **providers:** call_id stability for parallel/builtin/skill tool calls on the OpenAI-responses (ChatGPT/Codex) adapter — never-empty ids, no cross-wiring of interleaved items, bounded accumulators; fixes the desktop stuck-spinner class ([#133](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/133)) ([#137](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/137)) ([90e0fb2](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/90e0fb2e))
* **sandbox:** bound the Windows AppContainer availability probe (15s wall-clock guard) with a short-TTL negative cache — commands no longer hang ~120s per invocation when the probe stalls; fail-closed posture unchanged ([#125](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/125)) ([#127](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/127)) ([263793b](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/263793b9))
* **npm:** staleness self-heal in the npx launcher — warns with the exact-version cache-busting command when the spec-keyed npx cache serves an old engine; docs pinned to `@latest` ([#126](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/126)) ([#134](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/134)) ([3ebbc72](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/3ebbc72c))


### Tests & Hardening

* **providers:** tool-name codec round-trip regression suite incl. the direct-DeepSeek delegation pin ([#139](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/139)) ([#140](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/140)) ([abe516e](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/abe516e2))
* **security:** quick-xml RUSTSEC-2026-0194/0195 dispositioned (unreachable — embedded-dump-only syntect path), time-boxed with tracking ([#142](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/142)) ([#143](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/143)) ([4e74ddb](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/4e74ddb5))

## [0.12.19](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.18...v0.12.19) (2026-07-01)

A security-hardening release. Wayland Core tightens every seam where an untrusted
input — a checked-in project config, a wire peer, or a model-known identifier —
could quietly widen its own privileges. All fixes below are part of the
coordinated **GHSA-8r7g** approval/posture-hardening advisory and are covered by
new regression tests.

### Security Hardening (GHSA-8r7g)

* **Project configs can only tighten, never loosen.** A `.wayland-core.toml` that
  travels with a cloned repo is untrusted. It can no longer raise the approval
  posture — `approval_mode`, `auto_approve`, `allow_no_sandbox`, and the
  approval-skip `allow_list` are all clamped tighten-only against your global
  config, so opening a repo can never silently reduce approval friction or grant
  a tool blanket auto-approval ([#128](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/128)).
* **Project-defined hooks are default-denied.** A `[[hooks.*]]` `command` runs as
  a child process, so a project hook is arbitrary code execution from repo
  content. Project hooks are now dropped unless the operator opts in with
  `[hooks] trust_project_hooks = true` in their **global** config; a project
  cannot authorize its own hooks, and suppressed hooks are logged (not silent).
* **Auto-approving modes require a local opt-in over the wire.** Both `force` and
  `auto_edit` auto-approve tools (`auto_edit` covers file writes — a git hook or
  `authorized_keys` write is write-to-RCE). Neither can now be set by an
  un-opted-in wire peer; only `default` is accepted unless the operator launched
  with `--force` / `WAYLAND_ALLOW_WIRE_FORCE=1`.
* **Unforgeable approval resume tokens.** The in-process approval bridge now keys
  every pending approval by an opaque secret, indexing the public correlation id
  (a model-known `call_id`) separately. A wire/host peer must present the secret
  to resolve an approval — echoing a known `call_id` no longer self-approves —
  while local TUI keypresses resolve by correlation as before. (Also closes a
  latent gap where a bridge-backed approval — a Crucible council or an egress
  consent — parked mid-turn could hang on a JSON-stream host.)
* **Project skill hooks are default-denied too.** A project- or legacy-sourced
  skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter hooks run as child processes, so — like project
  config hooks — they are now dropped unless the operator opted in via the global
  `[hooks] trust_project_hooks`. A cloned repo's skill can no longer execute a
  hook on first tool use.

### Bug Fixes

* **providers:** sanitize Cohere MCP tool names through the shared codec so
  MCP-heavy profiles no longer 400 on Cohere, matching the cross-provider
  handling introduced for the other providers
  ([#129](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/129)) ([#131](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/131)).
* **providers:** sanitize MCP tool names across all provider paths so MCP-heavy
  profiles stop hitting name-shape 400s ([#130](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/130)).

## [0.12.18](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.17...v0.12.18) (2026-07-01)


### Bug Fixes

* **providers:** never send a role:"tool" message without a matching assistant tool_calls id — make truncation tool-pair aware and strip orphaned tool results/calls in both directions so native DeepSeek no longer 400s on long agentic conversations ([#123](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/123)) ([#124](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/124)) ([bf82b05](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/bf82b050))
* **providers:** keep an assistant message valid after its last tool_call is stripped (stamp empty content) so native DeepSeek no longer 400s with "content or tool_calls must be set" — found via live verification against api.deepseek.com ([#123](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/123)) ([#124](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/124)) ([bf82b05](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/bf82b050))

## [0.12.17](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.16...v0.12.17) (2026-06-30)


### Bug Fixes

* **agent:** resolve send_message channel by platform family so named instance channels (e.g. email-imap) receive sends ([#116](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/116)) ([#117](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/117)) ([82b590c](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/82b590c3))
* **agent:** cap project-context (AGENTS.md / @-includes) injection to bound the cached system prefix ([#115](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/115)) ([#118](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/118)) ([9cdf420](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/9cdf420e))
* **providers:** strip internal extra_content from outbound tool_calls so long-context replay to strict providers no longer 400s ([#120](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/120)) ([#121](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/121)) ([525a90f](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/525a90f2))


### Dependencies

## [0.12.16](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.15...v0.12.16) (2026-06-29)


### Bug Fixes

* **bash:** fall back to cmd when PowerShell shell is selected under AppContainer ([#105](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/105)) ([d698c66](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/d698c663f0f361912ed25f532a83e519305c246a))
* **engine:** never let the reasoning budget starve the visible answer ([#426](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/426)) ([#107](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/107)) ([60f8e7d](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/60f8e7d649a4a2fa684c4228b620a9ea8d0491fd))
* **providers:** replay reasoning_content for strict reasoners routed via a router ([#417](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/417)) ([#108](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/108)) ([fac4bde](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/fac4bde7eecc2b3c31ec7c20927034432eea4bfa))
* **web:** bound readability extraction + reset breakers per turn + telemetry schema ([#403](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/403)) ([#106](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/106)) ([43c7aac](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/43c7aac819e649c72383edd58be446d94856ace7))

## [0.12.15](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.14...v0.12.15) (2026-06-28)


### Bug Fixes

* **providers:** keyless self-hosted endpoints (no more "OpenAI API key is required" on local Ollama) ([#102](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/102)) ([28d5eac](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/28d5eac64851b9e404bd371f59768ee41890d9e9))

## [0.12.14](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.13...v0.12.14) (2026-06-28)

A focused Windows reliability release: it makes the sandboxed shell tool work end-to-end on Windows, fixing two AppContainer defects that left tool-use broken in the field.

### Highlights

- **Windows shell tools no longer hard-fail on machines without dev caches.** The AppContainer filesystem allowlist always includes optional developer caches (`~/.cache`, `~/.cargo`, `~/.npm`, `~/.rustup`). On any machine that doesn't have them — i.e. virtually every non-developer Windows box — applying the DACL grant aborted the *entire* command with `GetNamedSecurityInfoW … 0x2`, so every sandboxed shell command failed before it ran. Absent allowlist paths are now skipped, the grant succeeds, and commands execute normally. This is why the earlier AppContainer subprocess fixes ([#321](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/321)–[#324](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/324)) didn't translate into working shells in the field.
- **Sandboxed commands can no longer hang past their timeout.** `cmd.exe` spawns a console host (`conhost.exe`) that can outlive the command and keep the captured stdout/stderr pipes open; the output drain then blocked waiting for an EOF that never arrived — observed as a 120-second "command timed out" with no output on disconnected RDP sessions. The backend now reaps the entire job tree before draining, so output always flushes and the call returns a bounded result (or a clean, prompt timeout) instead of hanging. ([#100](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/100))

## [0.12.13](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.12...v0.12.13) (2026-06-27)

A reliability-focused release: a new **capability-first tools gate** so models that can't do function calling degrade gracefully instead of failing the turn, a major Windows sandbox fix, and a round of audited provider- and config-layer hardening.

### Highlights

- **Tool-incapable models just work now — across local and cloud backends.** Point Wayland Core at a model that doesn't support function calling and the turn no longer dies on a raw provider error. Ollama models are detected up front via `/api/show` and have their `tools` array dropped before the request is even sent. Any backend that rejects tools with a `400` — llama.cpp started without `--jinja` (`tools param requires --jinja flag`), or an Ollama model that 400s with `does not support tools` — is caught, retried without tools, and **remembered**, so every later turn for that model skips tools pre-emptively. Tool-incapable Bedrock models (DeepSeek-R1 reasoning, Stability image, Titan/Cohere embedding) are name-gated the same way. Tool-*capable* models are unaffected — they keep their tools and call them exactly as before. ([#389](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/389))
- **The Windows sandbox runs real subprocesses again.** The AppContainer backend no longer caps active processes too aggressively (`ActiveProcessLimit` raised to 512), resolves the launch shell correctly, and emits clearer diagnostics when a shell can't be found — so multi-step tool use works under the sandbox on Windows. ([#321](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/321), [#322](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/322), [#323](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/323), [#324](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/324))

### Provider reliability

- **Anthropic errors are classified correctly.** Non-credit Anthropic API errors are no longer misread as out-of-credit / billing failures, so genuine transient errors surface instead of a misleading "purchase credits" signal. ([#329](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/329))
- **Flux reasoning summaries render as thinking.** A FluxRouter `reasoning_summary` is now decoded into a per-turn thinking subject, so reasoning summaries appear as proper thinking content. ([#318](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/318))

### Configuration & hygiene

- **Config surface tightened.** `env_passthrough` is now wired through, unknown configuration keys produce a warning (via `serde_ignored`) instead of being silently dropped, and the sandbox configuration surface is exposed as a toggle. ([#325](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/325), [#326](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/326), [#327](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/327))

## [0.12.12](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.11...v0.12.12) (2026-06-27)

### Crucible reliability & cost accuracy

This release hardens the Crucible (Mixture-of-Providers) council and the pricing engine behind it — every fix here was found by putting Crucible through a live, cross-vendor proof run and watching where it strained.

- **Bring-your-own pricing catalogs now load.** A custom `WAYLAND_PRICING_PATH` catalog parses reliably, so you can price any model the bundled catalog doesn't yet cover — and Crucible can certify a real spend ceiling against it.
- **Accurate Gemini pricing.** Gemini's live API slugs (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash`) now resolve to the catalog correctly, so Gemini members are priced — and counted — when Crucible assembles a cost-diverse council.
- **Broader Opus support in councils.** Anthropic's Opus 4.x models, which decline an explicit sampling temperature, are now handled cleanly both as proposers and as the fusing judge.

Backed by new regression tests across `wcore-pricing` and `wcore-providers`.

## [0.12.11](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.10...v0.12.11) (2026-06-27)

This release is headlined by **Crucible**, our cross-provider Mixture-of-Providers council — wayland-core's answer to single-model ceilings — folded together with two audited reliability and security fixes.

### ✨ Headliner — Crucible (Mixture-of-Providers)

* **crucible:** a cross-provider council you run with `wayland-core crucible "<task>"`. N proposers, **each pinned to a different LLM provider**, work the task in parallel; a fenced, read-only **aggregator** fuses their answers into one. Three ways to run it: `--auto` gates convening behind a cheap difficulty classifier (trivial tasks get a single direct call, high-stakes tasks convene the full council); `--advisor` injects the fused synthesis into the normal trusted agent loop as private guidance (the agent then reasons, acts, and uses tools on it); `--terminal` prints the fused answer and stops. Includes per-tier proposer/aggregator temperatures, provenance-fenced injection containment, per-proposer **and** global soft deadlines with quorum, and `[crucible]` budget/daily-cap guards. Tri-model cross-audited; 151 dedicated tests. ([#91](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/pull/91))

### Enhancements

* **tools:** `image_generate` and `text_to_speech` now follow your active provider instead of assuming a single hardcoded host. FluxRouter and native OpenAI sessions route to the correct endpoint with the correct key (with proper `/v1` API-root resolution), gracefully fall back to FAL / Gemini Imagen / Hugging Face FLUX via their env keys, and **fail closed** on a base URL carrying embedded credentials. ([#310](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland/issues/310))

### Security & Hardening

* **mcp:** MCP tool curation is now driven purely by **BM25 relevance + recency**. Removed a name-based "rescue" boost that a third-party MCP server could exploit by naming a tool like a built-in to jump the curation budget — closing a budget-hijack vector with no impact on built-in tools (which are never curated). ([#89](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland/issues/89))

### Validation

* Full cross-platform gate green — **9,411 tests** across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Features

* **mcp:** provider-aware hard cap on total tool count + real MCP server provenance + BM25 relevance curation — caps the outbound tool array to the model's limit (OpenAI 128), fixing API-400 overflow with large MCP servers (Google Workspace, etc.); fixes uniquely-named MCP tools being misclassified as built-ins ([#86](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/86), [#344](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/344)/[#359](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/359)) ([#87](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/issues/87))

## [0.12.1](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/compare/v0.12.0...v0.12.1) (2026-06-18)

Stable release rolling up everything from the `0.12.1-rc.1` and `0.12.1-rc.2`
prereleases (full per-commit detail in the sections below).

### Highlights

* **Sign in with ChatGPT** — OpenAI Codex OAuth provider with rotating-refresh token manager, device-code login for headless/remote, and token import from the Codex CLI.
* **MiniMax provider** — via the Anthropic-compatible endpoint, visible in the provider/model pickers.
* **Forge zero-config MCP discovery** — one-command `/mcp connect` to a trusted loopback MCP server, scoped-token grant with `${cred:KEY}` headers (token never lands in `config.toml`), opt-in `allow_local`, and a selectable DISCOVERED row in `/doctor`.
* **Config cockpit** — paste-to-connect with live key fingerprinting + a validation ladder, an Essentials/Advanced settings surface, collection editors (tools/egress/failover), config-posture health and self-configure discovery in `/doctor`, a redacted `/effective` config preview, and channel-integration visibility.
* **Live model discovery** — Bedrock (`ListFoundationModels`), Gemini, and a connected-provider catalog refresh, backed by a per-provider 24h disk cache.
* **TUI** — arrow-key cross-provider `/model` and `/provider` pickers, the command palette on `/` from any surface, connection-aware provider listing.
* **Security & stability** — a 42-defect deep-sweep remediation: closed a Forge-MCP token-exfil SSRF, a Glob sandbox bypass, unbounded reads across MCP/Matrix/ACP, a provider key-pool poison DoS, skill-arg shell injection, and MCP header secret leaks; credentials now default to keyring with plaintext fallback (F16).
* **Core fixes** — Windows MCP stdio launch (#164) and the Anthropic unrecoverable-conversation `thinking.signature` 400 (#161); Flux Router reachable out of the box under the egress guard.

### Build System

### Build System

* **release:** prepare 0.12.1-rc.1 prerelease ([9c5922b](https://github.com/FerroxLabs/wayland-core/commit/9c5922b12b9fe35ba5636421619b756043a596ab))

## [0.11.0-rc.1] - 2026-06-11

Release candidate for 0.11.0. The headline is **inbound channels** — Wayland Core now receives, not just sends — plus native per-command Bash output compaction, a JWT crypto-backend security fix, and a batch of provider and platform fixes. Still a public beta; cut as an RC to soak the new network-facing channel surface before the final 0.11.0.

### Highlights

* **Inbound channels.** Two-way messaging across Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, Microsoft Teams, and SMS: inbound receive (long-poll / `/sync` / webhook host), an engine-backed turn dispatcher with a tool-posture scope for channel-originated agents, reconnect supervision so channels survive disconnects, Microsoft Teams Bot Framework JWT validation, outbound chunking with per-platform size caps, an idempotency nonce to dedupe retried sends, and react/typing with ack reactions + a typing keepalive state machine.
* **Auth-aware inbound media.** Images and audio attachments are fetched and described/transcribed before the turn, with credentials kept inside each connector boundary.
* **Native Bash output compaction.** Verbose `cargo` / `git` / test-runner / `grep` output is compacted into the model's transcript (the human still sees full output) — block-aware, fail-open, size-gated, default-on via `ProviderCompat::compact_bash`, with per-call savings telemetry.
* **Security.** Migrated the JWT crypto backend to `aws_lc_rs`, dropping `rsa` and eliminating RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (Marvin Attack) at the source. Closed a Grep RCE, skill/rules prompt-injection, and hook shell-execution hardening; capped stdin line length (newline-less OOM DoS); fail-closed on UTF-8 split-codepoint corruption.

### Providers

* gpt-5 family now routes to the OpenAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`).
* Gemini 2.5-class: split SSE frames on CRLF (stops false truncation); inject default items for array schemas (stops tool-registration 400s).
* Default moonshot/qwen to their international endpoints; pin `api_path` so 8 native providers stop 404ing.

### Fixes

* ALSA is no longer a hard dependency — `cpal` is gated behind an off-by-default `voice` feature, so the default binary runs on minimal Linux without `libasound` (#14).
* The `/config` providers pane now scrolls to keep the focused row visible on short terminals (#16).
* PATHEXT-aware `npx` detection on Windows so the IJFW MCP server registers (#6).
* Legacy-YAML migration no longer clobbers an existing `config.toml`.

### Extensibility

* Declarative on-disk plugins under the profile home, wiring hooks + MCP into the engine.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-08

First public release. Wayland Core is a domain-agnostic autonomous-agent engine written in Rust: terminal-first, multi-provider, MCP-native, and embeddable. It ships as a **public beta**, capable and open, and still hardening under a continuous endurance soak (see "Built to endure" in the README).

### Highlights

* **Multi-provider.** 7 native provider integrations (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Google Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock with SigV4, Cohere, Azure OpenAI) plus a 104-entry models.dev catalog, all behind one provider-neutral engine and a declarative ProviderCompat layer. Circuit-breaker resilience, mid-stream reconnect, and multi-key rotation across every API-key provider.
* **Orchestration.** Sub-agents, a git-worktree-isolated parallel swarm with a dirty-tree guard, declarative ForgeFlows workflows that lower onto the engine's own execution graph, and selectable reducers via `wayland swarm --reduce mesh|fleet|consensus|debate`.
* **Security by default.** A fail-closed OS-native sandbox (bubblewrap, sandbox-exec, AppContainer), a CI-enforced egress chokepoint with an exfil-shape classifier, an always-on SSRF and metadata floor, and argv-safe shell execution.
* **Extensibility.** MCP in both directions (a client, and a server that advertises and executes its own built-in tools, with runtime injection), roughly 70 built-in tools, skills, blocking lifecycle hooks, and a plugin API.
* **Embeddable.** A typed JSON-Lines protocol drives the engine headlessly behind a host app.
* **Self-evolution (GEPA).** A scored optimizer that evolves prompts and skills against your own reference cases.

### Surfaces

One binary, three ways to run it: a one-shot command, an interactive TUI, or a headless JSON stream.

### Notes

This is a public beta. APIs and behavior may change before 1.0. A continuous, fault-injected endurance trial is ongoing; the method, measurements, and honesty bounds are documented in [docs/resilience.md](docs/resilience.md).
